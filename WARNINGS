Things to watch out for, primarily on internal System V machines.

-----------------
dpost and picpack
-----------------

  By default this package removes the currently installed versions of
  dpost and picpack from directory POSTBIN (file dwb.mk) before installing
  the new dpost and picpack, which now only go in directory BINDIR (file
  dwb.mk). If your spooler (e.g. Unison) or other programs are looking
  for these programs in directory POSTBIN make the following changes
  BEFORE doing anything else,

	cd postscript/dpost
	cp dpost.mk.old dpost.mk
	cd ../pickpack
	cp picpack.mk.old picpack.mk

  dpost.mk.old and picpack.mk.old are makefiles that install dpost and
  picpack in both BINDIR and POSTBIN (as in DWB 3.0 and DWB 3.0.1).

--------
devopost
--------

  The devopost font tables are included in the source, but they're no
  longer supported and are not installed. If you need them add,

	postscript/devopost

  to the TARGETS list in file dwb.mk.

-----------
devpost.add
-----------

 The devpost.add tables are width tables for a collection of PostScript
 fonts not generally available on PostScript printers. The tables are not
 installed and not recommended, unless you're already using an older set.
 If you need them add,

	postscript/devpost.add

 to the TARGETS list in file dwk.mk.
