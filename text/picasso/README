			MAKING BATCH PICASSO

Yacc'ing picassoy.y should produce 328 shift/reduce conflicts.

When compiling xstubs.c, your compiler may issue warnings about formal
parameters not being used.  This is not a problem.

Using a make command-line option "DEFINES=-DNOWRITE" should produce
a version of picasso that refuses to write out any file.  This is an
easy way to make an interactive version that can be used for previewing
.pic files.  For batch picasso, about the only thing it would accomplish
is to allow someone to get the syntax errors out of their .pic files.

		     NEW FEATURES IN PICASSO 2.1

Various bugs have been fixed.

The specification of parameters to macros is now done through a separate
popup window.  (User interface improvement.) (Interactive only.)

The accessing of fonts has been speeded up.

The algorithm that calculates the page center has been changed, to try
to make it agree better with dpost (on some printers where the printable
area is not symmetric with the actual page, part of pictures included
with -mpictures got clipped).

The "Browse" buttons have removed from the file popup windows, since 
this feature depended on a connection only provided on some OPEN LOOK
implementations on 6386 machines. (Interactive only.)

If the Attach edit mode if on, newly created objects will snap to the
corners of already selected objects, and already selected objects will
remain selected when new objects are created.  (Interactive only.)

In order to provide a hook for the prtfmt command, the interactive
version now adds "#picasso" to the .PS line of output files, and
both versions deal with this string properly on input (by discarding
it).
