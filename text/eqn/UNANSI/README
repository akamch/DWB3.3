This version of the UNANSI tools is based on the troff version and is
meant for eqn only.


Kudo's to bwk & drexler send the flames to jaap


Basic conversion steps for new eqn source from bwk:

 1: Save a copy of the ansi source.

 2: Apply unansi to the unbwk'd source.

 3: Get unansi version to compile and run. Update unansi and cvt until
    they produce correct code.

 4: Combine ansi and unansi versions with merge. merge arguments are the
    directory containing ansi source from 2 and the directory with the
    final unansi source from 5. Run merge in a new directory - result is
    source that compiles unansi version with -DUNANSI and ansi version
    otherwise.

The Makefile is supposed to do this all automatically. Put the ansi
sources in the directory ansi-eqn. Run the make. The result will be in
directory kr-eqn.

Note that the sed and awk scripts are tested for the eqn

	char *version = "version Dec 3, 1991";

only and they are really geared toward this. The scripts might easely
break whenever there is more then just a trivial change in the ansi
source. The whole mechanisme is based on the unansi scripts for troff
by bwk & drexler.

	Good Luck!
