.SH NAME
.B dpcl
\-
.B troff postprocessor for \s-1PCL\s+1-based printers
.SH SYNOPSIS
\*(mBdpcl\f1
.OP "" options []
.OP "" files []
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dpcl
translates
.I files
created by
.BR troff (1)
into PCL and writes the results on the
standard output.
If no
.I files
are specified, or if
.OP \-
is one of the input
.IR files ,
the standard input is read.
The following
.I options
are understood:
.TP 1.0i
.OP \-c num
Print
.I num
copies of each page.
By default only one copy is printed.
.TP 1.0i
.OP \-o list
Print pages whose numbers are given in the comma-separated
.IR list .
The list contains single numbers
.I N
and ranges
.I N1\-N2.
A missing 
.I N1
means the lowest numbered page, a missing
.I N2
means the highest.
.TP 1.0i
.OP \-p mode
Print
.I files
in either portrait or landscape
.IR mode .
Only the first character of
.I mode
is significant.
The default
.I mode
is portrait.
.TP 1.0i
.OP \-r
Do not output
.SM PCL
reset sequences at the start and end of each job.
.TP 1.0i
.OP \-s
Download complete raster files, rather than individual character
bitmaps.
This results in significantly larger output files that should match
PCL output generated by older versions of
.BR dpcl .
.TP 1.0i
.OP \-x num
Translate the origin
.I num
inches along the positive x axis.
The default
coordinate system has the origin fixed near the
upper left corner of the page, with positive
x to the right and positive y down the page.
Positive
.I num
moves everything right.
The default offset is 0 inches.
.TP 1.0i
.OP \-y num
Translate the origin
.I num
inches along the positive y axis.
Positive
.I num
moves text down the page.
The default offset is 0.
.TP 1.0i
.OP \-F dir
Use
.I dir
as the font directory.
The default
.I dir
is
.MR \*(dF ,
and
.B dpcl
reads
.SM ASCII
font files from directory
.MR \*(dF/devpcl .
.TP 1.0i
.OP \-R dir
Use
.I dir
as the raster table directory.
The default
.I dir
is
.MR $DPCLRASTER ,
and
.I dpcl
reads raster files from directory
.MR $DPCLRASTER/rastpcl .
.TP 1.0i
.BI \-T name
Use font and raster files for device
.I name
when
.I files
are translated.
The default
.I name
is
.MW pcl
and
.B dpcl
reads
.SM ASCII
font files from
.MW \*(dF/devpcl
and host resident raster files from
.MR $DPCLRASTER/rastpcl .
.PP
All
.I files
should be prepared by
.B troff
for the same device.
The default font files and raster tables assume a 300-dpi
write-black printer.
.B dpcl
downloads individual character bitmaps as they are needed,
rather than downloading complete raster files.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
A typical command line might be:
.EX
pic \f2file\fP | tbl | eqn | troff -mm -Tpcl | dpcl
.EE
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
0 exit status is returned if
.I files
were successfully translated,
while 2 often indicates a syntax error in the input
.IR files .
.SH WARNINGS
.PP
Output produced by
.B dpcl
can only be printed on \s-1PCL\s+1-based printers that accept
downloadable fonts.
The default font and raster files are for a 300-dpi
write-black printer.
.PP
Emulation is expensive and does not always produce satisfactory results.
No attempt has been made to implement the character sets
or fonts available on all devices supported by
.BR troff .
Missing characters are replaced by white space,
and unrecognized fonts default to one of the Times fonts
(i.e.,
.MR R ,
.MR I ,
.MR B ,
or
.MR BI ).
