Limited troff support for LaserJet printers. Assumes your printer accepts
downloaded fonts. dpcl now downloads individual bitmaps as they're needed,
rather than sending complete raster files. A bit more work that produces
significantly smaller output files. Use -s (slow) to get the old behavior.
Use -r to eliminate the reset sequence at the start and end of dpcl output
files.

The default font tables and raster files (directory ./rastpcl) assume a
300dpi write-black printer. Raster files in ./rastPCL are slightly fatter.
They're unsupported but can produce better results on write-white printers.
Use the (undocumented) -BPCL option to rastPCL tables with devpcl fonts.
Raster files are installed in directory RASTDIR (see file ./laserjet.mk).
rastpcl and rastPCL each need about 5meg.

A typical command line would be,

    pic file | tbl | eqn | troff -mm -Tpcl | dpcl >file.pcl

file.pcl is PCL and can be sent directly to a printer.
