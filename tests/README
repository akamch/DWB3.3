Test files for troff, preprocessors, and macro packages. Install the
package and make sure your PATH picks up the new programs. To run the
tests and save the results in directory ./$(SYSTEM) (where SYSTEM is
defined in file tests.mk) type,

	make -f tests.mk install

By default the pipeline starts with pic (or grap) and ends with troff.
Set TROFF to FALSE as in,

	make -f tests.mk TROFF=FALSE install

to break the pipe after the appropriate preprocessor runs. Results are
again saved in directory ./$(SYSTEM).

Choose all (instead of install) to run the command pipeline and leave
the results (i.e. the .out files) in each test directory.

Set TDEVNAME on the command line to select a different output device.
For example,

	make -f tests.mk TDEVNAME=i300 install

formats files for printing on an Imagen 8/300. Define MACROS, as in,

	make -f tests.mk MACROS=-ms install

to use a different default macro package.

Choose clean (or clobber), as in,

	make -f tests.mk clean

to remove output files from the test directories.
