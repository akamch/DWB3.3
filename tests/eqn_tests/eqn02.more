       Let us consider D(t), the unit impulse (or Dirac) function.
       We shall define D(t) conceptually as a limit of time
       functions Dn(t), which: (i) vanish outsideS(-Sn,+Sn), (ii)
                             n                    n
       are nonnegative in (-Sn,+Sn), (iii) have  ^  D(t)dt = 1 (iv)
            S                                   -Sn
             n
       lim  ^  D(t)dt = 0 (other alternatives for the approximating
        s  -Sn
       functions would also have been reasonable).

       We are now in a position to define and describe the
       important concept of the transfer func_Btion of an IS box.  We
       have already shown t_Khat if cos C_KtB_-> A cos(Ct+D) and K and n
       are integers, then n cos Ct -> n A cos(Ct+D).  If there is
       even a shred of continuity, we may extend the result for
       rationals to the reals.  Then for L real,
                                     B_
                       L cos Ct -> L A cos(Ct+D) .

       Now the expectations of the second and third series vanish
       term by term, while the o2thers yield
             ___     ___   - 2_J__
          ( |1_+_r_    |1_-_r_)    h2      2_J_
       -2 |\| 2  + \| 2 | e      cos h  U0, which we have already
       see(n to be small.) Here is another line of text so that it
       will continue underneath the in-line equation, and we can
       see how it looks.  Beware:  The square root symbol can only
       be as large as the largest size available on the target
       device.
