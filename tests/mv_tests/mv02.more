                            What the Walrus Said
        ``The time has come,'' the Walrus said,
        ``To talk of many things:

             +o  Of shoes-and ships-and sealing wax-
             +o  Of cabbages-and kings-

             +o  And why the sea is boiling hot-
             +o  And whether pigs have wings.''
