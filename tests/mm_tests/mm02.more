       This section describes simple paragraphs and section
       headings.

       1.1  PPPPaaaarrrraaaaggggrrrraaaapppphhhhssss

            .P [type]
            _o_n_e _o_r _m_o_r_e _l_i_n_e_s _o_f _t_e_x_t

       This macro is used to begin two kinds of paragraphs.  In a
       _l_e_f_t-_j_u_s_t_i_f_i_e_d paragraph, the first line begins at the left
       margin, while in an _i_n_d_e_n_t_e_d paragraph, it is indented five
       spaces.

       A document possesses a _d_e_f_a_u_l_t _p_a_r_a_g_r_a_p_h _s_t_y_l_e obtained by
       specifying .P before each paragraph that does _n_o_t follow a
       heading.  The default style is controlled by the register
       Pt.  The initial value of Pt is 0, which always provides
       left-justified paragraphs.  All paragraphs can be forced to
       be indented by inserting the following at the beginning of
       the document:

            .nr Pt 1

       All paragraphs will be indented except after headings,
       lists, and displays if the following:

            .nr Pt 2

       is inserted at the beginning of the document.

       The amount a paragraph is indented is contained in the
       register Pi, whose default value is 5.  To indent paragraphs
       by, say, 10 spaces, insert:

            .nr Pi 10

       at the beginning of the document.  Of course, both the Pi
       and Pt register values must be greater than zero for any
       paragraphs to be indented.

       The number register Ps controls the amount of spacing
       between paragraphs.  By default, Ps is set to 1, yielding
       one blank space (1/2 a vertical space).

       Regardless of Pt, an _i_n_d_i_v_i_d_u_a_l paragraph can be forced to
       be left-justified or indented.  ``.P 0'' always forces left
       justification; ``.P 1'' always causes indentation by the
       amount specified by the register Pi.

       If .P occurs inside a _l_i_s_t, the indent (if any) of the
       paragraph is added to the current list indent.

       Numbered paragraphs may be produced by setting the register
       Np to 1.  This produces paragraphs numbered within first
       level headings, e.g., 1.01, 1.02, 1.03, 2.01, etc.

       A different style of numbered paragraphs is obtained by
       using the

            .nP

       macro rather than the .P macro for paragraphs.  This
       produces paragraphs that are numbered within second level
       headings and contain a ``double-line indent'' in which the
       text of the second line is indented to be aligned with the
       text of the first line so that the number stands out.

       The .H macro provides seven levels of numbered headings, as
       illustrated by this document. Level 1 is the most major or
       highest; level 7 the lowest.

       The _h_e_a_d_i_n_g-_s_u_f_f_i_x is appended to the _h_e_a_d_i_n_g-_t_e_x_t and may
       be used for footnote marks which should not appear with the
       heading text in the Table of Contents.

       1.2.1  _N_o_r_m_a_l__A_p_p_e_a_r_a_n_c_e_.  The normal appearance of headings
       is as shown in this document.  The effect of .H varies
       according to the _l_e_v_e_l argument.  First-level headings are
       _p_r_e_c_e_d_e_d by two blank lines (one vertical space); all others
       are _p_r_e_c_e_d_e_d by one blank line (1/2 vertical space).

            .H 1 heading-text   gives a bold heading _f_o_l_l_o_w_e_d by a single
                                blank line (1/2 vertical space).  The
                                following text begins on a new line and is
                                indented according to the current
                                paragraph type.  Full capital letters
                                should normally be used to make the
                                heading stand out.

            .H 2 heading-text   yields a bold heading followed by a single
                                blank line (1/2 vertical space).  The
                                following text begins on a new line and is
                                indented according to the current
                                paragraph type.  Normally, initial
                                capitals are used.
            .H n heading-text   for 3 _< n _< 7, produces an underlined
                                (italic) heading followed by two spaces.
                                The following text appears on the same
                                line, i.e., these are _r_u_n-_i_n headings.

       Appropriate numbering and spacing (horizontal and vertical)
       occur even if the heading text is omitted from a .H macro
       call.

       Here are the first few .H calls in this document:

            .H 1 "PARAGRAPHS AND HEADINGS"
            .H 2 "Paragraphs"
            .H 3 "Numbered Headings"
            .H 3 "Normal Appearance."
            .H 3 "Altering Appearance of Headings."

            .H 4 "Spacing After Headings."
            .H 4 "Centered Headings."
            .H 4 "Bold, Italic, and Underlined Headings"
            .H 5 "Control by Level."

       with the default appearance of headings may skip to the
       section titled ``Unnumbered Headings''.  One can modify the
       appearance of headings quite easily by setting certain
       registers and strings at the beginning of the document.
       This permits quick alteration of a document's style, because
       this style-control information is concentrated in a few
       lines, rather than being distributed throughout the
       document.

       1.2.2.1  _P_r_e_-_S_p_a_c_i_n_g__a_n_d__P_a_g_e__E_j_e_c_t_i_o_n_.  A first-level
       heading normally has two blank lines (one vertical space)
       preceding it, and all others have one blank line (1/2
       vertical space).  If a multi-line heading were to be split
       across pages, it is automatically moved to the top of the

       next page.  Every first-level heading may be forced to the
       top of a new page by inserting:

            .nr Ej 1

       at the beginning of the document.  Long documents may be
       made more manageable if each section starts on a new page.
       Setting Ej to a higher value causes the same effect for
       headings up to that level, i.e., a page eject occurs if the
       heading level is less than or equal to Ej.

       1.2.2.2  _S_p_a_c_i_n_g__A_f_t_e_r__H_e_a_d_i_n_g_s_.  Three registers control
       the appearance of text immediately following a .H call.
       They are Hb (heading break level), Hs (heading space level),
       and Hi (post-heading indent).

       If the heading level is less than or equal to Hb, a break
       occurs after the heading.  If the heading level is less than
       or equal to Hs, a blank line (1/2 vertical space) is
       inserted after the heading.  Defaults for Hb and Hs are 2.
       If a heading level is greater than Hb and also greater than
       Hs, then the heading (if any) is run into the following
       text.  These registers permit headings to be separated from
       the text in a consistent way throughout a document, while
       allowing easy alteration of white space and heading
       emphasis.

       For any _s_t_a_n_d-_a_l_o_n_e heading, i.e., a heading not run into
       the following text, the alignment of the next line of output
       is controlled by the register Hi.  If Hi is 0, text is
       left-justified.  If Hi is 1 (the _d_e_f_a_u_l_t value), the text is
       indented according to the paragraph type as specified by the
       register Pt.  Finally, if Hi is 2, text is indented to line
       up with the first word of the heading itself, so that the
       heading number stands out more clearly.

       For example, to cause a blank line (1/2 vertical space) to
       appear after the first three heading levels, to have no
       run-in headings, and to force the text following all
       headings to be left-justified (regardless of the value of
       Pt), the following should appear at the top of the document:

            .nr Hs 3
            .nr Hb 7
            .nr Hi 0

       1.2.2.3  _C_e_n_t_e_r_e_d__H_e_a_d_i_n_g_s_.  The register Hc can be used to
       obtain centered headings.  A heading is centered if its
       level is less than or equal to Hc, and if it is also stand-
       alone.  Hc is 0 initially (no centered headings).

       1.2.2.4.1  _C_o_n_t_r_o_l__b_y__L_e_v_e_l_.  Any heading that is underlined
       by _n_r_o_f_f is made italic by _t_r_o_f_f.  The string HF (heading
       font) contains seven codes that specify the fonts for
       heading levels 1-7.  The legal codes, their interpretations,
       and the defaults for HF are:

       _____________________________________________________________
       |_F_o_r_m_a_t_t_e_r |             _H_F _C_o_d_e             |  _D_e_f_a_u_l_t _H_F   |

       _|___________|__________________________________|_______________|

       Thus, all levels are underlined in _n_r_o_f_f and italic in
       _t_r_o_f_f.  The user may reset HF as desired.  Any value omitted
       from the right end of the list is taken to be 1.  For
       example, the following would result in two bold levels,
       three underlined (italic) levels, and two normal (roman)
       levels:

            .ds HF 3 3 2 2 2

       1.2.2.4.2  _N_r_o_f_f__U_n_d_e_r_l_i_n_i_n_g__S_t_y_l_e_.  _N_r_o_f_f can underline in
       two ways.  The normal style (.ul request) is to underline
       only letters and digits.  The continuous style (.cu request)
       underlines all characters, including spaces.  By default, MM
       attempts to use the continuous style on any heading that is
       to be underlined and is short enough to fit on a single
       line.  If a heading is to be underlined, but is too long, it
       is underlined the normal way (i.e., only letters and digits
       are underlined).

       All underlining of headings can be forced to the normal way
       by using the -rU1 flag when invoking _n_r_o_f_f.

       1.2.2.4.3  _H_e_a_d_i_n_g__P_o_i_n_t__S_i_z_e_s_.  The user may also specify
       the desired point size for each heading level with the HP
       string (for use with _t_r_o_f_f only).

            .ds HP [ps1] [ps2] [ps3] [ps4] [ps5] [ps6] [ps7]

       By default, the text of headings (.H  and .HU) is printed in
       the same point size as the body _e_x_c_e_p_t that bold stand-alone
       headings are printed in a size one point smaller than the
       body.  The string HP, similar to the string HF, can be
       specified to contain up to seven values, corresponding to
       the seven levels of headings.  For example:

            .ds HP 12 12 10 10 10 10 10



       Memorandum Macros                                 TEST: mm02

       specifies that the first and second level headings are to be
       printed in 12-point type, with the remainder printed in 10-
       point.  Note that the specified values may also be _r_e_l_a_t_i_v_e
       point-size changes, e.g.:

            .ds HP +2 +2 -1 -1

       If absolute point sizes are specified, then those sizes will
       be used regardless of the point size of the body of the
       document.  If relative point sizes are specified, then the
       point sizes for the headings will be relative to the point
       size of the body, even if the latter is changed.

       Null or zero values imply that the _d_e_f_a_u_l_t size will be used
       for the corresponding heading level.

            .HM [arg1] ... [arg7]

       The registers names H1 through H7 are used as counters for
       the seven levels of headings.  Their values are normally
       printed using Arabic numerals.  The .HM macro (heading mark
       style) allows this choice to be overridden, thus providing
       ``outline'' and other document styles.  This macro can have
       up to seven arguments; each argument is a string indicating
       the type of marking to be used.  Legal values and their
       meanings are shown below; omitted values are interpreted as
       1, while illegal values have no effect.

       By default, the complete heading mark for a given level is
       built by concatenating the mark for that level to the right
       of all marks for all levels of higher value.  To inhibit the
       concatenation of heading level marks, i.e., to obtain just
       the current level mark followed by a period, set the
       register Ht (heading-mark type) to 1.

       For example, a commonly-used ``outline'' style is obtained
       by:

            .HU heading-text

       .HU is a special case of .H; it is handled in the same way
       as .H, except that no heading mark is printed.  In order to
       preserve the hierarchical structure of headings when .H and
       .HU calls are intermixed, each .HU heading is considered to
       exist at the level given by register Hu, whose initial value
       is 2.  Thus, in the normal case, the only difference
       between:

            .HU heading-text

       and:

            .H 2 heading-text

       is the printing of the heading mark for the latter.  Both
       have the effect of incrementing the numbering counter for
       level 2, and resetting to zero the counters for levels 3
       through 7.  Typically, the value of Hu should be set to make
       unnumbered headings (if any) be the lowest-level headings in
       a document.

       .HU can be especially helpful in setting up appendices and
       other sections that may not fit well into the numbering
       scheme of the main body of a document.

       The text of headings and their corresponding page numbers
       can be automatically collected for a table of contents.
       This is accomplished by doing the following two things:

          +o specifying in the register Cl what level headings are
            to be saved

          +o invoking the .TC macro at the end of the document

       Any heading whose level is less than or equal to the value
       of the register Cl (contents level) is saved and later
       displayed in the table of contents.  The default value for
       Cl is 2, i.e., the first two levels of headings are saved.

       Due to the way the headings are saved, it is possible to
       exceed the formatter's storage capacity, particularly when
       saving many levels of many headings, while also processing

       displays and footnotes.  If this happens, the ``Out of temp
       file space'' diagnostic will be issued; the only remedy is
       to save fewer levels and/or to have fewer words in the
       heading text.

       By default, pages are numbered sequentially at the top of
       the page.  For large documents, it may be desirable to use
       page numbering of the form ``section-page,'' where _s_e_c_t_i_o_n
       is the number of the current first-level heading.  This page
       numbering style can be achieved by specifying the -rN3 or
       -rN5 flag on the command line.  As a side effect, this also
       has the effect of setting Ej to 1, i.e., each section begins
       on a new page.  In this style, the page number is printed at
       the _b_o_t_t_o_m of the page, so that the correct section number
       is printed.
