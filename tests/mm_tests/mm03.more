       J. M. Jones:

       Please use the following description for the Out-of Hours
       course _D_o_c_u_m_e_n_t _P_r_e_p_a_r_a_t_i_o_n _o_n _t_h_e _U_N_I_Xr _T_i_m_e-_S_h_a_r_i_n_g
       _S_y_s_t_e_m.

       The course is intended for clerks, typists and secretaries
       as well as members of administrative and technical staff who
       intend to use the UNIX system for preparing documentation.
       The course will cover such topics as:

       Environment:      utilizing a time-sharing computer system;
                         accessing the system; using appropriate
                         output terminals.

       Files:            how text is stored on the system;
                         directories; manipulating files.

       Text editing:     how to enter text so that subsequent
                         revisions are easier to make; how to use
                         the editing system to add, delete, and
                         move lines of text; how to make
                         corrections.

       Text processing:  basic concepts; use of general-purpose
                         formatting packages.

       Other facilities: additional capabilities useful to the
                         typist such as the _s_p_e_l_l, _d_i_f_f, and _g_r_e_p
                         commands, and a desk-calculator package.
