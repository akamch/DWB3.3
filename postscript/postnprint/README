ASCII file to PostScript translator. Expanded postprint (by
request) to handle escape sequences for reverse video and font
changes. The program is a preliminary version and it is NOT
supported. It's subject to change or elimination in the next
release. We eventually expect to include the capabilities
provided by postnprint in the default ASCII file translator.

Currently recognized escape sequences:

	<esc>O	increment shading level
	<esc>N	decrement shading level

	<esc>R	Courier
	<esc>I	Courier-Oblique
	<esc>B	Courier-Bold
	<esc>X	Courier-BoldOblique

The shading level controls the gray level of the background box.
Definitions in shade.ps control the number of background gray
levels and the minimum gray level. Both can be tuned. The escape
character (octal 33 by default) can be changed using the -e option.
Use -e0 to disable escape sequences. Requests made via escape
sequences persist across page boundaries.
