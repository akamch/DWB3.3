DWB3.3
======

This is a fork of the original Documenter's Workbench Release 3.3 which had
been made available as open source from AT&T Software Technology under Eclipse
Public License at http://www2.research.att.com/sw/download/.
The purpose of this fork is to make this software compile and working on
current UNIX systems while making only minimum changes to the source code.

Please refer to the file
[INSTALL](https://github.com/n-t-roff/DWB3.3/blob/master/INSTALL)
