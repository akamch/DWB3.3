DWB3.3

This is a fork of the original Documenter's Workbench Release 3.3 which had
been made available as open source from AT&T Software Technology under Eclipse

The purpose of this fork is to make this software compile and working on
current UNIX systems while making only minimum changes to the source code.

A list of the currently tested operating systems and DWB components can be
found in the
[porting status](https://github.com/n-t-roff/DWB3.3/wiki#porting-status).

Bugs can be reported at the
[issue list](https://github.com/n-t-roff/DWB3.3/issues).
