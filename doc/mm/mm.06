.H 1 "DOCUMENT STYLES"
The
.sM MM
package provides several document styles:  memoranda,
released papers, and external letters that conform to
a given company standard, and common business letters
in standard acceptable styles.
.H 2 "Memoranda, Released Papers, and External Letters"
One use of
.sM MM
is for the preparation of memoranda and released papers, 
which have special requirements for the first page and for the cover sheet.
The information needed for the memorandum or released paper
(title, author, date, etc.) is entered in the same way for
both styles; an argument to one macro
.cR .MT ) (
indicates which style is being used.
The following sections describe the macros used to provide this data.
The required order is shown in \(sc6.1.9.
.P
The same macros for memorandum and released paper styles are used
to generate external letters on preprinted stationary with company letterhead.
Appendix C shows the input and output samples for the
three document styles:  memoranda, released paper, and external letter.
.P
If no particular document style is desired, the
macros described in this section should be omitted from the input text.
If these macros are omitted,
the first page will simply have the page 
header followed by the body of the document.
.H 3 Title
.iS
\&.TL \f1[\*(iAcharging-case\f1] [\*(iA\|filing-case\f1]
.cA "one or more lines"
.cA "of title text"
.iE
The arguments to the
.cR .TL
macro are the charging case number(s) and filing case number(s).
The ``charging case'' is the case number to which time was charged for the
development of the project described in the memorandum (also referred 
to as Work Project Number).
The ``filing case'' is a number 
under which the memorandum is to be filed
(e.g., for library reference).
.P
The title of the memorandum or paper follows the
.cR .TL
macro and is processed in fill mode.
Multiple charging case numbers are 
entered as ``subarguments'' by separating each from the previous 
with a comma and a space, and enclosing the
.I entire
argument within double quotes.
Multiple filing case numbers are entered similarly.
For example:
.iS
\&.TL "12345, 67890" 987654321
On the Construction of a Table
of All Even Prime Numbers
.iE
The
.cR .br
request may be used to break the title on output into several
lines as follows:
.iS
\&.TL 12345
First Title Line
\&.br
Second Title Line
.iE
On output, the title appears after the word ``subject'' in the memorandum style.
In the released-paper style, the title is centered and bold.
.P
If only a charging case number or only a filing case number is given,
then it will be separated from the title in the memorandum style by 
a dash and will appear on the same line as the title.
If both case numbers are given and are the same, then ``Work Project Number and Filing
Case'' followed by the number will appear on a line following the title.
If the two case numbers are different, then separate lines for ``Work 
Project Number'' and ``File Case'' will appear after the title.
.br
.ne 7v
.H 3 Author(s)
.iS
\&.AU \*(iAname \f1[\*(iAinitials\f1] [\*(iAlocation\f1] [\*(iAorganization\f1] [\*(iA\|phone\f1] [\*(iAroom\f1] [\*(iAarg\f1] [\*(iAarg\f1] [\*(iAarg\f1]
\*(iR.AT \f1[\*(iAtitle\f1] \(el
.iE
The
.cR .AU
macro receives as arguments information that describes an author.
If any argument contains blanks it must be enclosed within double quotes.
The first six arguments must appear in the order given;  a separate
.cR .AU
macro is required for each author.
.P
The
.cR .AT
macro is used to specify the author's title.
Up to nine arguments may be given.
Each will appear in the signature block for
memorandum style on a separate line following the signer's name.
The
.cR .AT
must immediately follow the
.cR .AU
for the given author.
For example:
.iS
\&.AU "J. J. Jones" JJJ HO 98760 "(201) 949-1234" 1Z-234
\&.AT Director "Materials Research Laboratory"
.iE
In the ``from'' portion in the memorandum style, the author's name is
followed by ``Org.'' and the organization number on one line,
the location and room number together on one line, and the phone number\^*
.FS *
The argument
.cA phone
should be the complete phone number, including area code.
.FE
on another line.
The printing of the location, organization number, room number and phone number
may be suppressed on the first page of a memorandum by setting the register
.cR Au
to 0; the default value for
.cR Au
is 1.
The last three
.cA arg
arguments of the
.cR .AU
macro, if present, will follow this normal author information in the ``from'' 
portion, each on a separate line.
These last three arguments may be used for miscellaneous information,
such as the author's electronic address.
For example:
.iS
\&.AU "S. P. Lename" SPL MH 98765 "(201) 582-1234" 2G-444 attmail!spl
.iE
The name, initials, location, and organization are also used in the
signature block.
The author information in the ``from'' portion,
as well as the names and initials in the signature block will appear
in the same order as the
.cR .AU
macros.
.P
The names of the authors in the released-paper style
are centered below the title.
After the name of the last author, the company name
and the location are centered.
For the case of authors from different 
locations, see \(sc6.1.8; for authors from different companies, see \(sc6.1.7.2.
.H 3 "Document Number(s)"
.iS
\&.TM \f1[\*(iAnumber\f1] \(el
.iE
Internal documents (e.g., technical memorandum or internal memorandum)
are usually identified by document numbers.
The document identification numbers are supplied via the
.cR .TM
macro:
.iS
\&.TM 12345-890101-01TM 12355-890101-03TM
.iE
Up to nine numbers may be specified.
On output, the document
identification number(s) will be listed following the ``from''
section of memoranda.
.H 3 "Abstract"
.iS
\&.AS \f1[\*(iAmode\f1] [\*(iAindent\f1] [\*(iAtype\f1]
.cA "one or more lines of"
.cA "of abstract text"
\*(iR.AE
.iE
The
.cR .AS
(abstract start) and
.cR .AE
(abstract end) macros bracket the optional abstract.
Abstracts are printed on the first page of a document and/or on its cover sheet (if any).
Headings and displays are not permitted within an abstract.
.br
.ne 3v
.P
In a released paper and in a technical memorandum, if the
.cA mode
argument is 0,
the abstract will be printed on page 1 and
on the cover sheet (if any); if the
.cA mode
argument is 1, the abstract will appear only
on the cover sheet (if any).
.P
In an internal memorandum and in all other documents (other than external 
letters), if the 
.cA mode
argument is 0, the abstract will appear on the first page of the document
and there will be no cover sheet printed; if the
.cA mode
argument is 2, the abstract will appear only
on the cover sheet, which will be produced automatically in this case (i.e.,
without invoking the
.cR .CS
macro).
It is not possible to get either an abstract or a cover sheet with an external 
letter.
.P
The abstract is printed with ordinary text margins.
If a value is given for the
.cA indent
argument, it will be used as the amount of indentation from
both the left and right margins.
The indent amount must be an unscaled number and is treated as ens.
.P
By default, the abstract heading is ``ABSTRACT''.
If the
.cA type
argument is
.cR ER ,
the abstract heading is ``ERRATA'';
if the
.cA type
argument is
.cR AD ,
the abstract heading is ``ADDENDUM''.
.P
Headings and displays are not permitted within an abstract.
.H 3 "Other Keywords"
.iS
\&.OK \f1[\*(iAkeyword\f1] \(el
.iE
Up to nine topical keywords or keyword phrases may be specified as arguments to the
.cR .OK
macro.
If a keyword argument contains spaces, it must be enclosed within double quotes.
.H 3 "Memorandum Types"
.iS
\&.MT \f1[\*(iAtype\f1] [\*(iAaddress\f1]
.iE
The
.cR .MT
macro controls the format of the top part of the first
page of a memorandum or of a released paper, as well as the format 
of the cover sheet (if any).
The
.cA type
argument is used as follows to produced the corresponding
document styles:
.tr ~
.DS
.TS
center box tab(;);
c cf1 cf1
cf5 lf1 lf1.
\*(iAtype\fP;Document Style;Memorandum Heading
_

_
4;Released Paper
5;External Letter
_
"\f2string\fP";Memorandum;              \f2string\fP
.TE
.DE
.P
If
.cA type
indicates a memorandum style, then the appropriate heading will be
printed after the last line of author information.
If
.cA type
is longer than one character, then the string, itself, will be printed.
For example:
.iS
\&.MT "Technical Note #5"
.iE
A simple memorandum is produced by calling
.cR .MT
with a null (but not omitted) or zero argument.
.P
The second argument to
.cR .MT
is the name of the addressee of a memorandum or external letter;
if present, that name and the page number replaces the normal
page header on the second and succeeding pages.
For example:
.iS
\&.MT 1 "John Jones"
.iE
produces:
.DS I
John Jones \- 2
.DE
.P
With the released-paper style
.cR ".MT\ 4" ), (
the second argument serves a different purpose
(see \(sc6.1.8).
.P
In the external-letter style
.cR ".MT 5" ), (
only the title (without ``subject'') and the date are printed
in the upper left and right corners, respectively, on the first page.
It is expected that preprinted stationary will be used,
providing the author's company logo and address.
.H 3 "Date and Format Changes"
.H 4 "Changing the Date."
By default, the current date appears in the ``date'' part of a memorandum.
This can be overridden by using:
.iS
\&.ND \*(iAnew-date\f1
.iE
The
.cR .ND
macro alters the value of the string
.cR DT ,
which is initially set to the current date.
.H 4 "Alternate First-Page Format."
.P
One can specify an alternate format for the first page of memoranda and
change the company name used for any document style.
.iS
\&.AF \f1[\*(iAcompany-name\f1]
.iE
If an argument is given,
.cA company-name
replaces the default company name
on the first page of a released paper and in the letterhead block of a memoranda.
If the argument is null,
the company name is suppressed;
in this case, an extra blank line is inserted to allow room for
stamping the document with an appropriate name or signature element.
.P
For memoranda, use the
.cR -rA \*(iA\^n\fP
option (see \(sc2.3)
to supress the entire letterhead block to accommodate preprinted stationary.
The letterhead block includes the company name and logo as well as other
signature elements (i.e., rule across the page between logo and name) that
appear before the ``subject/date/from'' block.
.P
The command line option \*(iR\-rE\*(iAn\f1
controls the font of the information fields in the ``subject/date/from'' block
on memoranda.
.P
The user-definable string
.cR }Z
contains the company name,
and the string
.cR ]S
contains the company logo.
These string definitions are initialized in the file
.cR /usr/lib/tmac/strings.mm \|.
(Use the
.cR .AF
macro to redefine the company name string.)
.H 3 "Released-Paper Style."
The released-paper style is obtained by specifying:
.iS
\&.MT 4 \f1[\*(iR1\f1]
.iE
The released paper style provides a titlebox that contains:
.BL "" 1
.LI
the title of the paper (emboldened)
.LI
the author's names (italicized), each on a separate line
.LI
the company name
.LI
the company address (city, state, zip code)
.LE
.P
Each line in the titlebox is centered.
The location of the last author is used to determine the company address.
If the second argument
is the digit
.cR 1 ,
then the name of each author is followed by the respective 
company name and address.
.P
Information necessary for the memorandum style but not for the
released-paper style is ignored.
In addition, the macros described in \(sc6.3
and their associated lines of input are ignored when the released-paper
style is specified.
.P
In the released-paper style, location codes
are defined as strings that contain the address of the corresponding location.
(See Appendix G for a list of location codes and addresses.)
Authors from non-affiliated locations may include their company name in the
released-paper style by specifying the company name with the
.cR .AF
macro and defining a string (with a two-character name such as
.cR XX )
for the address before each
.cR .AU .
.P

.H 3 "Sequence of ``Beginning'' Memorandum/Paper/Letter Macros."
The macros described in \(sc6.1, if present, must be given in
the following order:
.iS
\&.ND \*(iAnew-date
\*(iR.TL \f1[\*(iAcharging-case\f1] [\*(iA\|filing-case\f1]

.cA "lines of notation list"
\*(iR.NE
.iE
The only required macros for a memorandum or a released paper  are
.cR .TL ,
.cR .AU ,
and
.cR .MT ;
all the others (and their associated input lines)
may be omitted if the features they provide are not needed.
All macros before
.cR .MT
simply collect information for their respective parts.
The
.cR .MT
macro then uses that information to produce the document in
the desired format.
(The macros following
.cR .MT
are discussed in \(sc6.3.)
.H 2 "Business Letters"
In addition to the document styles produced with
.cR .MT ,
you can obtain an entirely different style using a set of macros
designed to produce common business letters.
The information needed for business letters is entered in the same way;
an argument to one macro
.cR .LT ) (
indicates which style is being used.
Appendix D shows the input and output samples for each of the
four types of common business letters.
.H 3 "Letter Types"
.iS
\&.LT \f1[\*(iAtype\f1]
.iE
The letter-type macro
formats a business letter in one of four common styles:  blocked,
semi-blocked, full-blocked, and simplified.
Use the
.cA type
argument to select the desired format:
.DS CB F
.TS

T}
SP	T{
\f4Simplified\f1
\(em
The same as the full-blocked format, except the salutation
is replaced by a subject line and is followed by an additional blank line,
the closing is omitted, and the writer's identification is on a single line.
The subject and writer's identification lines are in all-capital letters.
T}
.TE
.DE
.P
If
.cA type
is omitted,
.cR .LT
produces the ``blocked'' letter format.
.H 3 "Writer's Address"
.iS
\&.WA \*(iAname\0\f1[\*(iAtitle\f1]
.cA "one or more lines"
.cA "of the writer's address"
\*(iR.WE
.iE
.P
The writer's complete address (but not the name) appears
in the return-address block at the top of the letter.
The writer's name and title, if any, appear in the signature block
at the close of the letter.
.H 3 "Recipient's Address"
.iS
\&.IA \f1[\*(iAname\0\f1[\*(iAtitle\f1]]
\f1[\*(iAname\f1]
.cA "one or more lines"
.cA "of the recipient's address"
\*(iR.IE
.iE
.P
The inside address appears at the left margin before the salutation, if any.
The inside address contains the recipient's complete address and may also
include the recipient's name and title.
If the
.cA name
and
.cA title
arguments are given, they are used in the inside address,
each on a separate line, before the recipient's address;
otherwise, a name may be given as part of the address.
.H 3 "Letter Options"
.iS
\&.LO \*(iAtype\f1\0[\*(iAnotation\f1]
.iE
The
.cR .LO
(letter options)
macro provides the salutation and four additional components frequently
used in business correspondence.
Use the
.cA type
argument to select the desired component:
.DS
.TS
center box;
l cf1
lf5 lf1.
\*(iAtype\fP	Component
_
SA	Salutation
AT	Attention line
SJ	Subject line
RN	Reference line
CN	Confidential notation
.TE
.DE
A business letter may contain one or more component, or none at all.
Thus, the
.cR .LO
macro may be ignored or
it may be used multiple times
in any order to generate different components.
.H 4 Salutation.
.P
If
.cA type
is
.cR SA ,
the
.cR .LO
macro generates the salutation given in
.cA notation.
If
.cA notation
is not given, the saluation
``To Whom It May Concern:'' is used.
.P
The salutation appears two blank vertical spaces below the inside address
at the left margin.
.H 4 "Attention Line."
.P
If
.cA type
is
.cR AT ,
the
.cR .LO
macro generates an attention line of the form:
.DS I
ATTENTION:  \*(iAnotation\fP
.DE
If
.cA notation
is not given, the attention field is blank
(e.g., only ``ATTENTION:'' is used).
.P
The attention line appears two blank vertical spaces below the inside address
at the left margin.
The attention line is used to direct the letter to the attention of a
specific person or department.
.H 4 "Subject Line."
If
.cA type
is
.cR SJ ,
the
.cR .LO
macro generates a subject line of the form:
.DS I
Subject:  \*(iAnotation\fP
.DE
If
.cA notation
is not given, the subject field is blank
(e.g., only ``Subject:'' is used).
.P
The subject line appears one blank vertical space below the salutation
at the left margin.
Using a subject line allows your correspondents (or their secretary) to
locate previous correspondence on the same subject.
.H 4 "Reference Line."
If
.cA type
is
.cR RF ,
the
.cR .LO
macro generates a reference line of the form:
.DS I
In reference to:  \*(iAnotation\fP
.DE
If
.cA notation
is not given, the reference field is blank
(e.g., only ``In reference to:'' is used).
.P
The reference line appears two blank vertical spaces below the date and is
aligned left with the date.
Using a reference line allows your correspondents (or their secretary) to
locate previous correspondence on the same subject.
.H 4 "Confidential Notation."
If
.cA type
is
.cR CN ,
the
.cR .LO
macro generates the notation ``Confidential'' below the date,
aligned left with the date.
If
.cA notation
is given, it replaces ``Confidential'' below the date.
.H 3 "Sequence of Business Letter Macros"
The macros
.cR .WA ,
.cR .WE ,
.cR .IA ,
.cR .IE ,
and
.cR .LT
are mandatory and
must be given in the following order:
.iS

.cA "lines of notation list"
\*(iR.NE
.iE
.hy
If the
.cR .ND
(see \(sc6.1.7.1) or
.cR .LO
macros are used, they must appear before the
.cR .LT
macro.
All macros \%before
.cR .LT
simply collect information for their respective parts.
The
.cR .LT
macro then uses that infor\%ma\%tion to produce the letter in
the desired format.
(The macros following
.cR .LT
are discussed in the next section.)
.nh
.H 2 "Macros for the End of a Memorandum or Letter"
The signatures of the authors and a list of notations can be requested
at the end of a memorandum, external letter, or business letter.
The following macros provide information for the signature block
and notation list;
these macros and their input are ignored for the released-paper style.
(See the examples in Appendix\ C and Appendix\ D.)
.H 3 "Signature Block."
The signature block consists of the formal closing (if any),
a signature line for each author, and an optional reference line.
The signature line includes the author's name preceded by a sufficient amount
of space for the author's signature.
.P
The signature block is not used in the released-paper style.
.H 4 "Formal Closing"
.iS
\&.FC \f1[\*(iAclosing\|\f1]
.iE
The
.cR .FC
macro generates the formal closing at the end of an external letter.
The closing appears before the signature, so the
.cR .FC
macro must precede the
.cR .SG
macro.
By default,
``Yours very truly,'' is used as the formal closing.
If the
.cA closing
argument is given, it will be used as the closing.
For example,
.iS
\&.FC "Sincerely,"
.iE
generates ``Sincerely,'' as the formal closing before the signature.
.H 4 "Signature and Reference Line"
.iS
\&.SG \f1[\f2initials\f1] [\*(iR1\f1]
.iE
.P
The
.cR .SG
macro prints the author's names after the formal closing, if any.
Each name begins at the center of the page.
Three blank lines are left above each name for the actual signature.
.P
A reference line appears at the left margin on the same line as the
last author's name.
The reference line contains the location code, organization number,
author's initials, and typist's initials, separated by hyphens.
The typist's initials are supplied as an argument to the
.cR .SG
macro; the location code, organization number, and author's initials
are taken from the
.cR .AU
macro.
If the
.cR .SG
macro is used with no arguments, the reference line is suppressed.
If the
.cA initials
argument is null, the reference line is printed without the typists's
initials nor the preceding hyphen.
.P
If there are several authors and if the second argument is the digit
.cR 1 ,
then the reference data is placed on the same line
as the name of the first author,
rather than the last author.
In this case,
the reference data contains only the location and organization number 
of the first author.
Thus, if there are authors from different 
organizations and/or from different locations, the reference data should
be supplied manually after the
.cR .SG
macro:
.iS
\&.SG
\&.rs
\&.sp -1v
\&PY/MH-9876/5432-JJJ/SPL-cen
.iE
In this case, the
.cR .SG
macro must be used alone, with no arguments.
.H 3 "``Copy to'' and Other Notations"
.iS
\&.NS \f1[\*(iAtype\f1] [\*(iR1\f1]
.cA "zero or more lines"
.cA "of notation list"
\*(iR.NE
.iE
After the signature and reference data, many types of notations may 
follow, such as a list of attachments or ``copy to'' lists.
The various notations are obtained through the
.cR .NS
macro, which provides for the proper spacing and for
breaking the notations across pages, if necessary.

If
.cA type
is omitted or null,
the default notation ``Copy to'' is used.
If
.cA type
consists of a multiple-character text string, it is placed 
within parentheses between the words ``Copy'' and ``to.''  For example:
.iS
\&.NS "with att. 1 only"
.iE
will generate ``Copy (with att. 1 only) to'' as the notation.
If the second argument is the digit
.cR 1 ,
then
.cA string
is used as the entire notation.
.P
More than one notation may be specified before the
.cR .NE
macro occurs, because a
.cR .NS
macro terminates the preceding notation, if any.
For example:
.iS
\&.NS 4
Attachment 1\e*(EMList of register names
Attachment 2\e*(EMList of string and macro names
\&.NS 1
J. J. Jones
\&.NS 2
S. P. Lename
G. H. Hurtz
\&.NE
.iE
would be formatted as:
.DS I
Atts.
Attachment 1\*(EMList of register names
Attachment 2\*(EMList of string and macro names
.sp 0.5v
Copy (with att.) to
J. J. Jones
.sp 0.5v
Copy (without att.) to
S. P. Lename
G. H. Hurtz
.DE
The
.cR .NS
and
.cR .NE
macros may also follow
.cR ".AS 2"
and
.cR .AE
to place the notation list on
the cover page, if any.
If notations are given 
at the beginning without
.cR ".AS 2" ,
they will be saved and output
at the end of the document.

.H 3 "Approval Signature Line"
.iS
\&.AV \*(iAapprover's-name\| \f1[\*(iR1\f1]
.iE
The
.cR .AV
macro may be used after the last notation block to automatically
generate a line with spaces for the approval signature and date.
The approver's name is printed below the signature line.
For example:
.iS
\&.AV "R. U. Sure"
.iE
produces:
.DS I
APPROVED:
.sp 2
.ta +4.2iC
\l'3i'	\l'1.5i'
R. U. Sure	Date
.ta
.DE
.P
If the second argument is the digit
.cR 1 ,
then the ``APPROVED:'' mark is suppressed.
This feature is helpful for successive calls to
.cR .AV
when multiple approval lines are required.
For example:
.iS
\&.AV "R. U. Sure"
\&.AV "I. M. Certain" 1
\&.AV "B. A. Sporte" 1
.iE
produces:
.DS I
APPROVED:
.sp 2
.ta +4.2iC
\l'3i'	\l'1.5i'
R. U. Sure	Date
.sp 2
\l'3i'	\l'1.5i'
I. M. Certain	Date
.sp 2
\l'3i'	\l'1.5i'
B. A. Sporte	Date
.ta
.DE
.sp 0.5v
.H 2 "Forcing a One-Page Letter"
At times, one would like just a bit more space on the page, forcing the
signature or items within notations onto the bottom of the page, so that
the letter or memo is just one page in length.
This can be accomplished by increasing the page length through the
\*(iR\-rL\*(iAn\f1 option (e.g.,
.cR \-rL12i
for a 12-inch page length).
This has the effect of making the 
formatter believe that the page is longer and therefore
has more room than usual to place the signature or the notations.
This will only work for a single-page letter or memorandum.
