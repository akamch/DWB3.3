.H 1 "PAGE HEADERS AND FOOTERS"
Text that occurs at the top of each page is known as the page header. 
Text printed at the bottom of each page is called the page footer.
There can be up to three lines of text associated with
the page header and the page footer:
every page, even page only, and odd page only.
Thus, the page header may have up to two lines of text:  the
line that occurs at the top of every page and
the line for the even- or odd-numbered page.
Likewise, the page footer may have up to two lines of text:  the
line that occurs at the bottom of every page and
the line for the even- or odd-numbered page.
.P
This section describes the default appearance of page headers and
page footers and ways to change them.
The term ``header'' (not qualified by ``even'' or ``odd'')
refers to the line of the page header that occurs on every page,
and similarly for the term ``footer''.
.br
.ne 1i
.H 2 "Default Headers and Footers"
By default, each page has a centered page number as the header.  
There is no default footer and no even\^/odd default headers or footers,
except when pages are numbered sequentially within sections.
In a document whose style is controlled by the
.cR .MT
or the
.cR .LT
macro, the page header on the first page
is automatically suppressed provided a break does not occur before the
.cR .MT
or the
.cR .LT
macro is called.
The macros and text of \(sc6.1-\(sc6.2. and \(sc9 as well as
.cR .nr
and
.cR .ds
requests do not cause a break and are permitted before the
.cR .MT
or the
.cR .LT
macro call.
.P
Pages can be numbered sequentially within sections.
To obtain this numbering style, specify 
.cR \-rN3
or
.cR \-rN5
on the command line.
In this case, the default footer is a centered \*(iAsection\fP-\*(iApage\fP
number (e.g., ``9\(hy1''), and the default page header is blank.
.P
The current page number is often used in the page header or the
page footer (see \(sc9.4).
By default, the page number contained in the
.cR P
register is an Arabic number.
The format of the page number may be changed with the
.cR .af
request
(e.g., use format
.cR i
for lower-case Roman numerals.)
.P
If ``debug mode'' is set using the flag
.cR \-rD1 
on the command line, additional information
is included in the default header at the top left of each page.
.H 2 "Page Header"
.iS
\&.PH \f1[\*(iAheader\f1]
.iE
The argument
.cA header
is of the form
.iS
"'\*(iAleft\*(iR'\*(iAcenter\*(iR'\*(iAright\*(iR'"
.iE
This form applies to the argument
.cA header
for the
.cR .EH
and
.cR .OH
macros as well.
If it is inconvenient to use the apostrophe
.cR ' ) (
as the delimiter
(i.e., because it occurs within one of the parts), it may be replaced
uniformly by any other character.
On output, the parts are left-justified, centered, and right-justified,
respectively.
.P
The
.cR .PH
macro specifies the header that is to appear at the top of every page.
By default, the page header is defined as a centered page number surrounded by hyphens.
.H 3 "Even-Page Header"
.iS
\&.EH \f1[\*(iAheader\f1]
.iE
The
.cR .EH
macro supplies a line to be printed at the top of each
even-numbered page, immediately following the header.
The even-page header is not defined by default
so the initial value is a blank line.
.H 3 "Odd-Page Header"
.iS
\&.OH \f1[\*(iAheader\f1]
.iE
The
.cR .OH
macro supplies a line to be printed at the top of each
odd-numbered page, immediately following the header.
The odd-page header is not defined by default
so the initial value is a blank line.
.H 2 "Page Footer"
.iS
\&.PF \f1[\|\*(iAfooter\f1]
.iE
The argument
.cA footer
is of the form
.iS
"'\*(iAleft\*(iR'\*(iAcenter\*(iR'\*(iAright\*(iR'"
.iE
(same as for page headers).
This form applies to the argument
.cA footer
for the
.cR .EF
and
.cR .OF
macros as well.
If it is inconvenient to use the apostrophe
.cR ' ) (
as the delimiter
(i.e., because it occurs within one of the parts), it may be replaced
uniformly by any other character.
On output, the parts
are left-justified, centered, and right-justified, respectively.
.P
The
.cR .PF
macro specifies the line that is to appear at the bottom of each page.
The page footer is not defined by default so
the initial value is a blank line.
If the \*(iR\-rC\*(iAn\f1
flag is specified on the command line, the type of copy 
follows the footer on a separate line.
In particular, if 
.cR \-rC3
or
.cR \-rC4
.sM DRAFT ) (
is specified, then, in addition, the
footer is initialized to contain the date instead of being
a blank line.
.H 3 "Even-Page Footer"
.iS
\&.EF \f1[\|\*(iAfooter\f1]
.iE
The
.cR .EF
macro supplies a line to be printed at the bottom of
each even-numbered page, immediately preceding the footer.
The even-page footer is not defined by default so
the initial value is a blank line.
.H 3 "Odd-Page Footer"
.iS
\&.OF \f1[\|\*(iAfooter\f1]
.iE
The
.cR .OF
macro supplies a line to be printed at the bottom of
each odd-numbered page, immediately preceding the footer.
The odd-page footer is not defined by default
so the initial value is a blank line.
.H 3 "Footer on the First Page."
By default, page footers are not defined so the resulting lines are blank.
If one specifies
.cR .PF
and\^/or
.cR .OF
before the end of the first page of the document,
then these lines will appear at the bottom of the first page.
.P
The header (whatever its contents) replaces the footer on the 
first page only if the
.cR \-rN1 
option is specified on the command line
(see \(sc2.3).
.H 2 "Use of Strings and Registers in Header and Footer Macros"
String and register names may be placed in the arguments to the header
and footer macros.
If the value of the string or register is to be
computed when the respective header or footer is printed, the
invocation must be escaped by four (4) backlashes.
This is because the
string or register invocation will be processed three times:
.BL "" 1
.LI
as the argument to the header or footer macro;
.LI
in a formatting request within the header or footer macro;
.LI
in a
.cR .tl
request during header or footer processing.
.LE 1
For example, the page number register
.cR P
must be escaped with four
backslashes in order to specify a header in which the page number is to
be printed at the right margin, e.g.:
.iS
\&.PH "'''Page \e\e\e\enP'"
.iE
creates a right-justified header containing the word ``Page'' followed by
the page number.
Similarly, to specify a centered footer with the ``section-page'' 
style, use:
.iS
\&.PF "''- \e\e\e\en(H1-\e\e\e\enP -''"
.iE
As another example, suppose that the user arranges for the string
.cR a]
to contain the current section heading which is to be printed at the 
bottom of each page.
The
.cR .PF
macro call would then be:
.iS
\&.PF "''\e\e\e\e*(a]''"
.iE
If only one or two backslashes were used, the footer would print a
constant value for
.cR a] ,
namely, its value when the
.cR .PF
appeared in the input text.
.P
The following sequence specifies blank lines for the header and footer
lines, page numbers on the outside edge of each page (i.e., top left 
margin of even pages and top right margin of odd pages), and ``Revision\ 3''
on the top inside margin of each page:
.iS
\&.PH ""
\&.PF ""
\&.EH "'\e\e\e\enP''Revision 3'"
\&.OH "'Revision 3''\e\e\e\enP'"
.iE
.H 2 "Generalized Top-of-Page Processing \*(BU"
.P
During header processing,
.sM MM
invokes two user-definable macros:  the
.cR .TP
macro and the
.cR .PX
macro.
The
.cR .TP 
macro is invoked in the environment (see
.cR .ev
request) 
of the header; the
.cR .PX
macro is a user-exit macro that is
invoked (without arguments) when the normal environment has been
restored, and with ``no-space'' mode already in effect.
.P
The effective initial definition of
.cR .TP
(after the first page of a document) is:
.iS
\&.de TP
\&'sp 3
\&.tl \e\e*(}t
\&.if e 'tl \e\e*(}e
\&.if o 'tl \e\e*(}o
\&'sp 2
\&..
.iE
.br
.ne 5v
The string
.cR }t
contains the header (for every page), the string
.cR }e
contains the even-page header, and the string
.cR }o
contains the odd-page header, as defined by
.cR .PH ,
.cR .EH 
and
.cR .OH ,
respectively.
To obtain more specialized page titles, the user may redefine
.cR .TP
to cause any desired header processing (see \(sc12.3.2).
For example, to obtain a page header that includes three centered lines 
of data (a document's number, issue date, and revision date),
one could define
.cR .TP
as follows:
.iS
\&.de TP
\&.sp
\&.ce 3
777\-888\-999
Iss. 2, AUG 1977
Rev. SEP 1977
\&.sp
\&..
.iE
The
.cR .PX
macro may be used to supply text that is to appear at
the top of each page after the normal header and that may have tab
stops to align it with columns of text in the body of the document.
.H 2 "Generalized Bottom-of-Page Processing"
.iS
\&.BS
.cA "zero or more lines"
.cA "of bottom-block text"
\&.BE
.iE
Lines of text that are specified between the
.cR .BS
(bottom-block start)
and
.cR .BE
(bottom-block end) macros will be printed at the bottom of 
each page,
after the footnotes (if any), but before the page footer.
The bottom block will not appear on the cover sheet, if any.
This block of text is removed by specifying an empty block:
.iS
\&.BS
\&.BE
.iE
.H 2 "Proprietary Markings and Copyright Notice"
.iS
\&.PM \f1[\*(iAtype\f1] [\*(iA\|year\f1]
.iE
The
.cR .PM
macro generates a proprietary marking or copyright notice.
The marking appears at the bottom of the page following
the page footer (if any).
.P
By default,
a document does not carry a proprietary marking or copyright notice.
Use the
.cR .PM
macro with the following value for
.cA type
to generate the corresponding type of marking or notice:
.DS
.TS
center box tab(;);
c s s cf1
c1f5 c1p-2f1 cf5 lf1.
\*(iAtype\fP;Marking Type
_
\f2none\fP;or;0;turn off previous marking, if any
P;or;1;PROPRIETARY
RS;or;2;PROPRIETARY (RESTRICTED)
RG;or;3;PROPRIETARY (REGISTERED)
CP;or;4;``SEE COVER PAGE'' message
CR;or;5;Copyright notice
UW;or;6;Unpublished Work
.TE
.DE
An unrecognized
.cA type
will default to the PROPRIETARY marking.
.P
By default, the copyright notice
.cR CR ) (
and the ``Unpublished Work'' notice
.cR UW ) (
use the current year as the copyright date.
A year may be supplied as the second argument to
.cR .PM
to override the copyright date.
.P
See Appendix\ G for a sample of each type of marking.
.br
.ne 5v
.H 2 "Private Documents"
.iS
\&.nr Pv \*(iAvalue
.iE
The word
.sM PRIVATE '' ``
may be centered and underlined on the second
line of a document (preceding the page header).
This is done by setting the
.cR Pv
register:
.DS
.TS
center box tab(;);
c cf1
nf5 lf1.
\*(iAvalue\fP;Meaning
_
0;do not print PRIVATE (default)
1;PRIVATE on First page only
2;PRIVATE on all pages
.TE
.DE
.P
If
.cR Pv
is 2, the user-definable
.cR .TP
macro may not be used because
.cR .TP
is used by
.sM MM
to print
.sM PRIVATE '' ``
on all pages except the first page of a
memorandum on which
.cR .TP
is not invoked.
