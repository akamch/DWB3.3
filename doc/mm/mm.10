.H 1 "TABLE OF CONTENTS AND COVER SHEET"
The table of contents and the cover sheet for a document
are produced by invoking the
.cR .TC
and
.cR .CS
macros, respectively.
.P
These macros should normally appear only once at the end of the 
document, after the signature block
.cR .SG ) (
and notations (\*(iR.NS\fP/\*(iR.NE\fP) macros.
They may occur in either order.
.P
The table of contents is produced at the end of the document because the
entire document must be processed before the table of contents can be
generated.
Similarly, the cover sheet is often not needed, and is
therefore produced at the end.
.H 2 "Table of Contents"
.iS
\&.TC \f1[\*(iAslevel\|\f1] [\*(iAspacing\f1] [\*(iAtlevel\|\f1] [\*(iAtab\f1] [\*(iAhead1\f1] [\*(iAhead2\f1] [\*(iAhead3\f1] [\*(iAhead4\f1] [\*(iAhead5\f1]
.iE
The
.cR .TC
macro generates a table of contents containing the
headings that were saved for the table of contents
as determined by the value of the
.cR Cl
register.
The arguments to
.cR .TC
control the spacing before each entry, the placement of the associated page 
number, and additional text on the first page of the table of contents 
before the word
.sM CONTENTS '' ``
is printed.
.P
Spacing before each entry is controlled by the first two arguments; 
headings whose level is less than or equal to
.cA slevel
will have 
.cA spacing
blank vertical spaces before them.
Both
.cA slevel
and
.cA spacing
default to 1.
This means that first-level headings are preceded by one blank vertical space.
Note that
.cA slevel
does not control what levels of
heading have been saved; the saving of headings is the function of the
.cR Cl
register.
.P
The third and fourth arguments control the placement of the page
number of each heading.
The page numbers can be justified at the 
right margin with either blanks or dots separating the
heading text from the page number, or the page numbers can follow the
heading text.
For headings whose level is less than or equal to 
.cA tlevel
(default is 2),
the page numbers are justified at the right margin.
In this case, the value of
.cA tab
determines the character used to separate
the heading text from the page number.
If
.cA tab
is 0 (the default value), dots (i.e., leaders) are used; if
.cA tab
is greater than 0, spaces are used.
For headings whose level is greater than
.cA tlevel ,
the page numbers are separated from
the heading text by two spaces (i.e., they are ``ragged right'').
.P
All additional arguments (e.g.,
.cA head1 ,
.cA head2 ),
if any, are horizontally centered on the page,
and precede the actual table of contents itself.
.P
If the
.cR .TC
macro is invoked with at most four arguments, then
the user-exit macro
.cR .TX
is invoked (without arguments) before the word
.sM CONTENTS '' ``
is printed, or the user-exit macro
.cR .TY
is invoked and the word
.sM CONTENTS '' ``
is not printed.
By defining
.cR .TX
or
.cR .TY
and invoking
.cR .TC
with at most four arguments,
the user can specify what needs to be done at the top of
the first page of the table of contents.
For example:
.iS
\&.de TX
\&.ce 2
Special Application
Message Transmission
\&.sp 2
\&.in +10n
Approved:  \el'3i'
\&.in
\&.sp
\&..
\&.TC
.iE
yields:
.DS I
.ce 2
Special Application
Message Transmission
.sp 2
.in +10n
Approved:  \l'3i'
.in
.sp
.ce
CONTENTS
.sp
.DE
.P
If this macro were defined as
.cR .TY
rather than
.cR .TX ,
the word
.sM CONTENTS '' ``
would not appear.
Defining
.cR .TY
as an empty macro will suppress
.sM CONTENTS '' ``
with no replacement:
.iS
\&.de TY
\&..
.iE
By default, the first level headings will appear in the table of contents
at the left margin.
Subsequent levels will be aligned with the text of 
headings at the preceding level.
These indentations may be changed by defining the
.cR Ci
string which takes a maximum of seven arguments
corresponding to the heading levels.
It must be given at least as many
arguments as are set by the
.cR Cl
register.
The arguments must be scaled.
For example, if
.cR Cl
is 5,
.cR Ci
would be defined as:
.iS
\&.ds Ci .25i .5i .75i 1i 1i
.iE
or
.iS
\&.ds Ci 0 2n 4n 6n 8n
.iE
Two other registers are available to modify the format of the table
of contents,
.cR Oc
and
.cR Cp .
By default, table of contents pages will
have lower-case Roman numeral page numbering.
If the
.cR Oc
register is set to 1, the
.cR .TC
macro will not print any page number but
will instead reset the
.cR P
register to 1.
It is the user's responsibility
to give an appropriate page footer to place the page number.
Ordinarily, the same
.cR .PF
used in the body of the document will be adequate.
.P
The List of Figures, List of Tables, List of Exhibits, and
List of Equations pages will be produced separately unless
.cR Cp
is set to 1 which causes these lists to appear on the same
page as the table of contents.
.H 2 "Cover Sheet"
For document styles that allow a cover sheet
(e.g., released-paper and memoranda), the format of the cover sheet
resembles the first-page format of the document and includes the abstract.
Cover sheets are not generated for external letters and business letters.
