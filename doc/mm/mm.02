.H 1 "INVOKING THE MACROS"
This section tells how to access
.sM MM
and shows the typical
.sM UNIX
command lines to format an
.sM MM
document.
.H 2 "The \f(CB\-mm\fP Flag"
The
.sM MM
package can be invoked by including the
.cR \-mm
flag as an argument to the formatter.  
The
.cR \-mm
flag causes the file
.cR /usr/lib/tmac/tmac.m
to be read and processed before any
other files.
This action defines the
.sM MM
macros, sets default values for various parameters, and initializes
the formatter to be ready to process the files of input text.
.H 2 "Typical Command Lines"
The prototype command lines are as follows (with the various
options explained in \(sc2.3 and in the 
.IR "Troff User's Manual" ).
.BL
.LI
Plain text (no tables, equations, pictures or graphs):
.iS
troff -mm \f1[\*(iAoptions\f1]\0\*(iAfilename\*(iR | \(el
.iE
.LI
Text with tables:
.iS
tbl \*(iAfilename\f1 ... \*(iR| troff -mm \f1[\*(iAoptions\f1]\*(iR | \(el
.iE
.LI
Text with equations:
.iS
eqn usr/pub/eqnchar \*(iAfilename \*(iR| troff -mm \f1[\*(iAoptions\f1]\*(iR | \(el
.iE
.LI
Text with both tables and equations:
.iS
tbl \*(iAfilename\f1 \*(iR| eqn /usr/pub/eqnchar - | troff -mm \f1[\*(iAoptions\f1]\*(iR | \(el
.iE
.LI
Text with pictures:
.iS
pic \*(iAfilename\f1 \*(iR | troff -mm \f1[\*(iAoptions\f1]\*(iR | \(el
.iE
.LI
Text with graphs:
.iS
grap \*(iAfilename\f1 \*(iR| pic | troff -mm \f1[\*(iAoptions\f1]\*(iR | \(el
.iE
.LI
Text with the works (tables, equations, graphs and pictures):
.iS
grap \*(iAfilename\f1 \*(iR| pic | tbl | eqn | troff -mm \f1[\*(iAoptions\f1]\*(iR | \(el
.iE
.LE
.P
Preprocessing by
.I tbl
and
.IR eqn ,
if needed, must be invoked as shown in the command line prototypes.
If used,
.I eqn
immediately precedes
.IR troff .
Other preprocessors
.RI ( tbl ,
.IR pic ,
.IR grap )
are used before
.I eqn
and
.IR troff ,
but need not be in any particular order.
Since
.I grap
is a preprocessor to
.IR pic ,
you must use
.I grap
before
.IR pic .
.H 2 "Parameters that Can Be Set from the Command Line"
.I "Number registers"
are commonly used
to hold parameter values that control various aspects
of output style.
Many registers can be changed in
the text file with
.cR .nr
requests.
In addition,
some registers can be set from the
command line itself, a useful feature for those
parameters that should not be permanently
embedded within the input text itself.
If used, these registers (with the possible
exception of the register
.cR P )
.I must
be set on the command line before the
.sM MM
macro definitions are processed.
Their meanings are:
.in +0.25i
.VL 8
.LI \*(iR\-rA\*(iA\^n\f1
modifies the first-page format for memoranda and letters.
If
.cA n
is 1 (or any non-zero value),
the letterhead block is suppressed to accommodate preprinted stationary.
The letterhead block includes the company name and logo as well as any
other signature element that appears above the ``subject/date/from'' block.
.LI \*(iR\-rC\*(iAn\f1
sets the type of copy (e.g., 
.sM DRAFT )
to be printed at the bottom of each page:
.DS I
.TS
box;
c cf1
nf5 lf1.
\*(iAn\fP	Type of Copy
_
0	none (default)
1	OFFICIAL FILE COPY
2	DATE FILE COPY
3	DRAFT with single-spacing and default paragraph style
4	DRAFT with double-spacing and 10-en paragraph indent
5	double-spacing with 10-en paragraph indent
.TE
.DE
.LI \*(iR\-rD1\f1
sets \f2debug mode\f1.
This flag requests the formatter
to attempt to continue processing even if
.sM MM
detects errors that would otherwise cause termination.
It also includes some debugging information in the default page header. 
.LI \*(iR\-rE\*(iAn\f1
controls the font of the subject\^/\^date\^/\^from fields on
memoranda and letters.
If
.cA n
is 1, then these fields are emboldened.
If
.cA n
is 0, then these fields appear in the normal text font.
.LI \*(iR\-rL\*(iAk\f1
sets the length of the physical page to
.cA k
where
.cA k
is a scaled value.
The default page length is 11 inches (e.g.,
.cR 11i ).
.LI \*(iR\-rN\*(iAn\f1
specifies the page numbering style.
.DS I
.TS
box tab(;);
c cf1 cf1
nf5 lf1 lf1.
\*(iAn\fP;Page 1;Pages 2ff
_
0;header;header
1;header replaces footer;header
2;no header;header
3;``\*(iAsection\fP-\*(iApage\fP'' as footer;same as page 1
4;no header;no header unless \*(iR.PH\f1 defined
5;same as 3, with ``\*(iAsection\fP-\*(iAfigure\fP'';same as page 1
.TE
.DE
The contents of the prevailing header and footer do not
depend on the value of the number register
.cR N ;
.cR N
only controls whether and where the header
(and the footer if
.cR N
is 3 or 5)
is printed, as well as the page numbering style.
In particular, if the header and footer are
null, the value of
.cR N
is irrelevant.
.LI \*(iR\-rO\*(iAk\f1
sets the page offset (e.g., left margin) to
.cA k
where
.cA k
is a scaled value.
The default page offset is 1 inch
(e.g.,
.cR 1i ).
(The register
name is the capital letter O, not the digit zero 0.)
.LI \*(iR\-rP\*(iAn\f1
specifies that the pages of the document
are to be numbered starting with
.cA n .
This register may also be set via a
.cR .nr
request in the input text.
.LI \*(iR\-rS\*(iAn\f1
sets the point size and vertical spacing for the document.
By default,
.cA n
is 10, i.e., 10-point
type on 12-point vertical spacing.
.LI \*(iR\-rW\*(iAk\f1
sets the page width (i.e., line length and title length) to
.cA k
where
.cA k
is a scaled value.
The default page width is 6 inches
(e.g.,
.cR 6i ).
.LE
.in -0.25i
.H 2 "Omission of \f(CB\-mm\fP"
If a large number of arguments is required on the command
line, it may be convenient to set up the first (or only)
input file of a document as follows:
.iS
.cA "any initializations of registers in \(sc2.3"
\&.so /usr/lib/tmac/tmac.m
.cA "remainder of text"
.iE
.P
In this case, one must not use the
.cR \-mm
flag; the
.cR .so
request has the equivalent effect, but the registers in
\(sc2.3 must be initialized
before the
.cR .so
request, because their values are meaningful only if
set before the macro definitions are processed.
When using this method, it is best to ``lock'' into
the input file only those parameters that are seldom changed.
For example:
.iS
\&.nr L 9i
\&.nr W 5i
\&.nr O 0.5i
\&.nr N 3
\&.so /usr/lib/tmac/tmac.m
\&.H 1 "INTRODUCTION"
\0\(el
.iE
.P
specifies a page length of 9 inches,
a page width (i.e., line length) of 5 inches,
a page offset of one-half inch,
and ``section-page'' numbering.
