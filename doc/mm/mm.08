.H 1 "FOOTNOTES"
There are two macros that delimit the text of footnotes,
a string used to automatically number the footnotes,
and a macro that specifies the style of the footnote text.
.iS
\&\0\(el\|\*(iAmark\*(iR
\&.FS \f1[\*(iAlabel\f1]
.cA "one or more lines"
.cA "of footnote text"
\*(iR.FE
.iE
.P
The segment of text to be footnoted is immediately followed by the
footnote mark.
If a label is supplied to
.cR .FS ,
then it will be used to mark the footnote;
otherwise the footnote will be numbered automatically.
Automatically-numbered footnotes and user-labeled footnotes may be intermixed.
.P
The
.cR .FS
(footnote start)
and
.cR .FE
(footnote end)
macros mark the beginning and end of the footnote text.
The text between
.cR .FS
and
.cR .FE
is processed in fill mode.
Another
.cR .FS ,
a
.cR .DS
or a
.cR .DF
are not permitted between the
.cR .FS
and
.cR .FE
macros.
.P
Appendix E illustrates footnote styles using
both automatically-numbered footnotes and labeled footnotes.

.H 2 "Automatically-Numbered Footnotes"
Footnotes may be numbered automatically by
invoking the string
.cR \e*F '' ``
immediately after the text to
be footnoted, without any intervening spaces.
This will place the
next sequential footnote number (in a smaller point size) a half-line
above the text to be footnoted.
The footnote text follows, enclosed in the
.cR .FS
and
.cR .FE
macro pair.
Since the footnote number is generated automatically,
.cR .FS
is used with no argument.
For example:
.iS
This is the segment of text\e*F
\&.FS
This is the text of the footnote.
The same number is used to mark the text
and the footnote.
\&.FE
to be footnoted.
.iE
produces an automatically-numbered footnote.
.P
The number register
.cR :p
keeps track of the current footnote number.
The string
.cR F
automatically increments register
.cR :p
and then uses that value as the footnote number in the footnote mark;
the
.cR .FS
macro uses that same value to mark the text of the footnote.
The
.cR :p
register may have its format or value changed to affect the footnote marks.
.P
Automatically-numbered footnotes may not be used in a title
(following
.cR .TL ),
in an abstract
(between
.cR .AS
and
.cR .AE ),
or in a table
(between
.cR .TS
and
.cR .TE ).
.H 2 "Labeled Footnotes"
.P
Footnotes may be labeled manually by using the footnote label
immediately after the text to be footnoted,
without any intervening spaces.
The footnote text follows, enclosed in the
.cR .FS
and
.cR .FE
macro pair.
The same label used in the text must be supplied as an argument to the
.cR .FS
macro.
For example:
.iS
This is the segment of text*
\&.FS *
This is the text of the footnote.
An asterisk is used to mark the text
and to label the footnote.
\&.FE
to be footnoted.
.iE
produces a labeled footnote.
If more than one labeled footnote appears on the same page,
care must be taken to choose a different label for each footnote.
.H 2 "Spacing Between Footnote Entries"
Normally, one blank vertical space separates the 
footnotes when more than one occurs on a page.
To change this spacing, set the register
.cR Fs
to the desired value.
For example:
.iS
\&.nr Fs 2
.iE
will cause two blank vertical spaces to occur between footnotes.
.H 2 "Format of Footnote Text \*(BU"
.iS
\&.FD \f1[\*(iAmode\f1] [\*(iR1\f1]
.iE
The user can control the formatting style of the footnote text by
specifying text hyphenation, right margin justification, and text
indentation, as well as left- or right-justification of the label when
text is indented.
The
.cR .FD
macro is used to select the style.
The argument
.cA mode
determines the particular combination of hyphenation,
indentation, and margin and label justification that
defines each style:
.DS
.TS
center box tab(;);
c   cf1 cf1 cf1 cf1
c   cf1 cf1 cf1 cf1
nf5 cf1 cf1 cf1 lf1.
;;Right Margin;;Label
\*(iAmode\fP;Hyphenation;Justification;Text Indent;Justification

0;off;on;on;left-justified
1;on;on;on;left-justified
2;off;off;on;left-justified
3;on;off;on;left-justified
4;off;on;off;left-justified
5;on;on;off;left-justified

7;on;off;off;left-justified
8;off;on;on;right-justified
9;on;on;on;right-justified
10;off;off;on;right-justified
11;on;off;on;right-justified
.TE
.DE
.P
The default value for
.cA mode
is 0.
If
.cA mode
is omitted, null, or out of range, the default value is used.
(Hyphenation is turned on and off with the
.cR .hy
and
.cR .nh
requests, respectively.
Right margin justification is turned on and off
with the
.cR .ad
and
.cR .na
requests, respectively.)
.P
If the second argument is the digit
.cR 1 ,
then automatically-numbered footnotes begin afresh with ``1'' when
a first-level heading is encountered.
This feature is most useful with ``section-page'' numbering.
.P
Footnotes are separated from the body of the text by a short rule.  
Footnotes that continue to the next page are separated from the body 
of the text by a full-width rule.
Footnotes are set
in type that is two points smaller than the point size used in the 
body of the text.
.P
For long footnotes that continue onto the following page, it is
possible that, if hyphenation is permitted, the last line of the
footnote on the current page will be hyphenated.
Except for this case (which can be controlled by specifying
an even-numbered value for
.cA mode ),
hyphenation across pages is inhibited by
.sM MM .
