.H 1 REFERENCES
There are two macros that delimit the text of references,
a string used to automatically number the references,
and an optional macro to produce the reference page(s)
within the document.
The input format for a reference is:
.iS
\*(iAsegment of text to be referenced\|\*(iR\e*(Rf
\&.RS \f1[\*(iAstring-name\f1]
.cA "one or more lines of"
.cA "reference text"
\*(iR.RF
.iE
The string
.cR Rf
generates the reference mark.
The
.cR .RS
and
.cR .RF
macros delimit the text of each reference.
The reference text is saved and printed on the reference page at
the end of the document.
The argument
.cA string-name
may be used to keep track of a particular reference mark
for subsequent references.
.H 2 "Automatic Numbering of References"
The string call
.cR \e*(Rf
generates an automatically-numbered reference mark in the text.
The reference mark consists of the reference number
enclosed in square brackets,
and is printed in a smaller size and raised
(e.g., superscripted).
.P
The register
.cR :R
keeps track of the current reference number.
The string
.cR Rf
automatically increments
.cR :R
and then uses that value as the reference number in
the reference mark.
The
.cR :R
register may have its format or value changed
to affect the reference marks.
.H 2 "Subsequent References"
The
.cR .RS
macro accepts one argument
.cA string-name ) (
and uses it as the name of string for subsequent references.
If given,
.cA string-name
is assigned the current reference mark and
can be used later in the document to reference text
which must be labeled with a prior reference number.
No \*(iR.RS\fP/\*(iR.RF\fP pair is needed for subsequent references
marked in the text.
For example, if the input for a reference was:
.iS
and the ABC package\e*(Rf
\&.RS aA
A. B. Smith and J. R. Doe,
\&.ul
The ABC Package \e(em Reference Manual,
SoftPackagers, Inc.
\&.RF
.iE
and that reference was numbered ``4'', then later
in the document, the input:
.iS
is available with ABC\e*(aA as well.
.iE
produces:
.DS I
.ds rX 4
is available with ABC\*(rF as well.
.DE
.H 2 "Reference Page"
A reference page will be generated
automatically at the end of the document (before the table of
contents and the cover sheet, if any) and will be listed in the table of
contents.
This page contains the reference items (i.e., text enclosed
in \*(iR\&.RS\fP/\*(iR.RF\fP pairs).
Reference items will be separated by one blank vertical space;
if the register
.cR Ls
is set to 0, this spacing is suppressed.
.P
The string
.cR Rp
contains the reference page title.
By default, ``REFERENCES'' is used as the title.
The user may change the reference page title by defining the
.cR Rp
string:
.iS
\&.ds Rp List of References
.iE
.br
.ne 5v
.P
The
.cR .RP
macro may be used to produce the reference
page anywhere else within a document (i.e., after each major section);
.cR .RP
is not needed to produce a separate reference page with
default spacings at the end of the document.
.iS
\&.RP \f1[\*(iAarg1\f1] [\*(iAarg2\f1]
.iE
The two arguments allow the user to control resetting of reference
numbering and page skipping.
.DS
.TS

2;do not cause a preceding \*(iR.SK\fP
3;no \*(iR.SK\fP before or after
.TE
.DE
.P
If
.cR .RP
does not issue a
.cR .SK ,
then a single blank vertical space will 
separate the references from the preceding or following text.
The user may wish to adjust the spacing.
For example:
.iS
\&.sp 3
\&.RP 1 2
\&.H 1 "Next Section"
.iE
produces references at 
the end of each major section.
