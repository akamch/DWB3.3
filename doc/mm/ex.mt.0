.H 1 "PARAGRAPHS AND HEADINGS"
This section describes the types of paragraphs and the
kinds of headings that are available.
.H 2 Paragraphs
Paragraphs are specified by the .P macro.
Usually, they are flush left.
The number register Pt is used to change the paragraph style.
.H 2 Headings
.H 3 "Numbered Headings."
There are seven levels of numbered headings.
Level 1 is the most major or highest;
level 7, the lowest.
.P
Headings are specified with the .H macro,
whose first argument is the level of heading
(1 through 7).
.P
On output, level-1 headings are preceded by two blank lines;
all others, by one blank line.
Level-1 and level-2 headings are normally emboldened and
stand apart from the text that follows;
levels 3 through 7 are normally italicized and run in with the
text that follows.
.H 3 "Unnumbered Headings."
The macro .HU is a special case of .H, in that no heading
number is printed.
Each .HU heading has the level given by the register Hu,
whose initial value is 2.
Usually, the value of that register is set to make
unnumbered headings occur at the lower heading level
in a document.
