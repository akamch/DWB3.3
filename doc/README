Each directory contains a README file (similar to this one)
with the following information:

 - original document title and author
 - revision and reprint
 - list of files with purpose
 - command line needed to produce document body and appendices

Files that begin with "PS." are the PostScript output files created
using the software in this release; these PostScript files were 
used to produce the final camera-ready master copy for this
documentation package.

The file "Run" is a shell script that formats the entire document,
creates the PostScript output files (one for each part of the document),
and prints the document as a whole.  The resulting PostScript output
files are not removed upon exit, but are saved to produce additional
master copies, if needed.
