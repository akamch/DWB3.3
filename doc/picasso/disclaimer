AT&T Computer Systems asked that we add a disclaimer about
OPEN LOOK Picasso. They are afraid of getting a lot of
phone calls from customers upset that they didn't get the
right Picasso with DWB. All I need below is: your macros
for getting the page style right, and page number ii.
We'll insert it after the TOC in the Picasso divider.
