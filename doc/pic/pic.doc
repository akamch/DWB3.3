\s-1PIC\s+1 \(em A Graphics Language for Typesetting
.tE
.aS
.I Pic
is a language for drawing simple figures
on a typesetter.
The basic objects in
.I pic
are
boxes,
circles,
ellipses,
lines,
arrows,
arcs,
spline curves,
and text.
These may be placed anywhere,
at positions specified absolutely
or in terms of previous objects.
The example below illustrates the style and basic capabilities
of the language.

.I Pic 
is a
.I troff
preprocessor;
it passes most of its input through untouched, but translates
commands between
.cR .PS
and
.cR .PE
into
.I troff
commands that draw the pictures.
.aE
.H 1 INTRODUCTION
.I Pic
is a language for drawing
pictures.
It operates as yet another
.I troff
preprocessor
(in the same style as
.I eqn
and
.IR tbl ),
with pictures delimited by
.cR .PS
and
.cR .PE .
.I Pic
is a procedural language\*(EMa picture
is drawn by specifying (sometimes in painful detail)
the motions that one goes through to draw it.
.P
This document is primarily a user's manual for
.IR pic .
The next section shows how to use
.I pic
in the most simple way.
Subsequent sections describe how to change
the sizes of objects when the defaults are wrong,
and how to change their positions when the standard positioning rules
are wrong.
An appendix describes the language succinctly.
.H 1 BASICS
.I Pic
provides boxes, lines, arrows, circles, ellipses, arcs,
and splines (smooth curves),
plus facilities for positioning
and labeling them.
The picture below shows all of the fundamental objects
(except for splines)
in their default sizes:
.DS CB
.PS
box "box"
move
line "line" above
move
arrow "arrow" above
move
circle "circle"
move
ellipse "ellipse"
move down .25 right
arc "arc"
.PE
.DE
.br
.ne 5.5v
Each picture begins with
.cR .PS
and ends with
.cR .PE ;
between them are commands to describe the picture.
Each command is typed on a line by itself.
For example
.iS
\&.PS
box "this is" "a box"
\&.PE
.iE
creates a standard box (\(34 inch wide, \(12 inch high)
and centers the two pieces of text in it:
.DS CB
.PS
box "this is" "a box"
.PE
.DE
.P
Each line of text is a separate quoted string.
Quotes are mandatory, even if the text contains no blanks.
(Of course there needn't be any text at all.)
Each line will be
printed in the current size and font,
centered horizontally, and separated
vertically by the current
.I troff
line spacing.
.I Pic
does
not
center the complete drawing itself,
but the default definitions of
.cR .PS
and
.cR .PE
in the
.cR -ms
macro package do.
With the
.cR -mm
macro package, the picture should be enclosed in a centered-block
display.
.P
You can use
.cR circle
or
.cR ellipse
in place of
.cR box :
.DS CB
.PS
circle "this is" "a box"
move; move
ellipse "this is" "a box"
.PE
.DE
.P
Text is centered on lines and arrows; if there is more than one
line of text, the lines are centered above and below:
.iS
line "this is" "a line"
.iE
.DS CB
.PS
line "this is" "a line"
.PE
.DE
.iS
arrow "this is" "an arrow"
.iE
.DS CB
.PS
arrow "this is" "an arrow"
.PE
.DE
.rs
.sp 0.5v
.P
Boxes and lines may be dashed or dotted;
just add the word
.cR dashed
or
.cR dotted
after
.cR box
or
.cR line :
.iS
line dashed "dashed" "line"
.iE
.DS CB
.PS
line dashed "dashed" "line"
.PE
.DE
.rs
.sp 0.5v
.P
Arcs by default turn 90 degrees counterclockwise from the current direction;
you can make them turn clockwise by saying
.cR arc
.cR cw :
.iS
line; arc; arc cw; arrow
.iE
.DS CB
.PS
line; arc; arc cw; arrow
.PE
.DE
A spline might well do this job better; we will return to that shortly.
.P
As you might guess,
.iS
arc; arc; arc; arc
.iE
draws a circle, though not very efficiently.
Notice that several commands can be put on a single line
if they are separated by semicolons.
.br
.ne 0.8i
.P
Objects are normally drawn one after another,
left to right,
and connected at the obvious places:
.iS
arrow; box "input"; arrow; box "process"; arrow; box "output"; arrow
.iE
.DS CB
.PS
arrow; box "input"; arrow; box "process"; arrow; box "output"; arrow
.PE
.DE
One way to leave a space is with
.cR move :
.iS
box; move; box; move; box
.iE
.DS CB
.PS
box; move; box; move; box
.PE
.DE
.P
Although objects are normally connected left to right,
this can be changed.
If you specify a direction (as a separate object), subsequent objects
will be joined in that direction:
.iS
down; box; arrow; ellipse; arrow; circle
.iE
.DS CB
.PS
down; box; arrow; ellipse; arrow; circle
.PE
.DE
.iS
left; box; arrow; ellipse; arrow; circle
.iE
.DS CB
.PS
left; box; arrow; ellipse; arrow; circle
.PE
.DE
Each new picture begins going to the right.
.P
Normally, figures are drawn at a fixed scale,
with objects of a standard size.
It is possible, however, to arrange that a figure be expanded or shrunk
to fit a particular width.
If the
.cR .PS
line contains a number, the drawing is forced to be that many inches wide,
with the height scaled proportionately.
Thus
.iS
\&.PS 3.5
.iE
causes the picture to be 3.5 inches wide.
If two dimensions are specified, the second is the height.
.P
.I Pic
is pretty dumb about the size of text in relation
to the size of boxes, circles, and so on.
There is no way to say
``make a box that just fits around this text''
or ``make this text fit inside this circle''
or ``draw a line as long as this text.''
Tight fitting of text
can generally only be done by trial and error.
.br
.ne 3.5
.P
Speaking of errors,
if you make a grammatical error in the way you describe
a picture,
.I pic
will complain and try to indicate where.
For example, the invalid input
.iS
box arrow box
.iE
will draw the message
.iS
pic: syntax error near line 5, file -
 context is
        box >>>  arrow <<<  box
.iE
The brackets
point to the place where the error was first noted;
it sometimes follows 
the word in error, although in this example it's right on target.
The filename
.cR - ' `
is the standard input.
.H 1 "CONTROLLING SIZES"
This section deals with how to
control the sizes of objects
when the default sizes are not what is wanted.
The next section deals with positioning them
when the default positions are not right.
.P
Each object that
.I pic
knows about
(boxes, circles, etc.) has
associated dimensions, like height, width, radius, and so on.
By default,
.I pic
tries to choose sensible default values for these dimensions,
so that simple pictures can be drawn with a minimum
of fuss and bother.
All of the figures and motions shown so far
have been in their default sizes:
.DS I
.TS
l l.
box	\(34" wide \(mu \(12" high
circle	\(12" diameter
ellipse	\(34" wide \(mu \(12" high
arc	\(12" radius
line or arrow	\(12" long
move	\(12" in the current direction
.TE
.DE
When necessary,
you can make any object any size you want:
.iS
box width 3 height 0.1; circle radius 0.1
.iE
.DS CB
.PS
	box wid 3 ht 0.1; circle radius 0.1
.PE
.DE
All positions and dimensions are in inches, so
the box is 3 inches wide and 1/10 inch high and the circle has radius 1/10 inch.
.P
An attribute like 
.cR width
changes only the one instance of the object.
You can also change the default size for all objects
of a particular type by assigning values to
.I pic
variables;
this will be discussed in \(sc6.
.P
The attributes of
.cR height
(which you can abbreviate to
.cR ht )
and
.cR width
(or
.cR wid )
apply to boxes, circles,
ellipses,
and to the head on an arrow.
The attributes of
.cR radius
(or
.cR rad )
and
.cR diameter
(or
.cR diam )
can be used for circles and arcs if they seem more natural.
.P
Lines and arrows are most easily drawn by specifying
the amount of motion from where you are right now,
in terms of directions.
Accordingly the words
.cR up ,
.cR down ,
.cR left
and
.cR right
and an optional distance can be attached to
.cR line ,
.cR arrow ,
and
.cR move :
.iS
line up 1 right 2
arrow left 2
move left 0.1
line <-> down 1 "height " rjust
.iE
.DS CB
.PS
line up 1 right 2
arrow left 2
move left 0.1
line <-> down 1 "height " rjust
.PE
.DE
.br
.ne 2v
The notation
.cR <->
indicates a two-headed arrow;
use
.cR ->
for a head on the end and
.cR <-
for one on the start.
Lines and arrows are really the same thing;
in fact,
.cR arrow
is a synonym for
.cR line
.cR -> .
.P
If you don't specify any distance after
.cR up ,
.cR down ,
etc.,
.I pic
uses the standard distance:
.iS
line up right; line down; line down left; line up
.iE
.DS CB
.PS
line up right; line down; line down left; line up
.PE
.DE
If you omit the direction associated with a distance,
the current direction is used.
.P
Boxes and lines may be dotted or dashed:
.iS
box dotted; line dotted; move; line dashed; box dashed
.iE
.DS CB
.PS
box dotted; line dotted; move; line dashed; box dashed
.PE
.DE
If there is a number after
.cR dot ,
the dots will be approximately that far apart.
You can also control the size of the dashes (at least somewhat):
if there is a length after the word
.cR dashed ,
the dashes will be that long,
and the intervening spaces will be as close as possible to that size:
.iS
line right 5 dashed; move left 5 down .25; right
line right 5 dashed 0.25; move left 5 down .25; right
line right 5 dashed 0.5; move left 5 down .25; right
line right 5 dashed 1
.iE
.DS CB
.PS
line right 5 dashed; move left 5 down .25; right
line right 5 dashed 0.25; move left 5 down .25; right
line right 5 dashed 0.5; move left 5 down .25; right
line right 5 dashed 1
.PE
.DE
Dotted or dashed attributes apply only to lines and boxes.
.P
You can make any object invisible by adding the word
.cR invis
after it.
This is particularly useful for positioning things correctly
near text:
.iS
box invis "input"; arrow; box invis "output"
.iE
.DS CB
.PS
box invis "input"; arrow; box invis "output"
.PE
.DE
.br
.ne 6.5v
.P
Text may be positioned on lines and arrows:
.iS
arrow "on top of"; move
arrow "above" "below"; move
arrow "above" above; move
arrow "below" below; move
arrow "above" "on top of" "below"
.iE
.rs
.sp 0.5v
.DS CB
.PS
arrow "on top of"; move
arrow "above" "below"; move
arrow "above" above; move
arrow "below" below; move
arrow "above" "on top of" "below"
.PE
.DE
.rs
.sp 0.5v
.P
The ``width'' of an arrowhead is the distance across
its tail;
the ``height'' is the distance along the shaft.
The arrowheads in this picture are default size and shape.
.P
As we said earlier, arcs go 90 degrees counterclockwise
from where you are right now, and
.cR arc
.cR cw
changes this to clockwise.
The default radius is the same as for circles,
but you can change it with the
.cR rad
attribute.
It is also easy to draw arcs between specific places;
this will be described in the next section.
.P
To put an arrowhead on an arc, use one of
.cR <- ,
.cR ->
or
.cR <-> ,
as with lines.
.P
In all cases,
unless an explicit dimension for some object is specified,
you will get the default size.
If you want an object to have the same size
as the previous one of that kind,
add the word
.cR same .
Thus
in the set of boxes given by
.iS
down; box ht 0.2 wid 1.5; move down 0.15; box same; move same; box same
.iE
.DS CB
.PS
down; box ht 0.2 wid 1.5; move down 0.15; box same; move same; box same
.PE
.DE
the dimensions set by the first
.cR box
are used several times;
similarly, the amount of motion for the second
.cR move
is the same as for the first one.
.P
You can change the default sizes of objects
by assigning values to the variables that define their values.
Here is the list, with their default values:
.DS I
.S -1
.TS
lf5 lf5 lf1.
boxwid = 0.75;	boxht = 0.5
linewid = 0.75;	lineht = 0.5
circlerad = 0.25;	arcrad = 0.25
ellipsewid = 0.75;	ellipseht = 0.5
movewid = 0.75;	moveht = 0.5
textwid = 0;	textht = 0
arrowwid = 0.05;	arrowht = 0.1	(These refer to the arrowhead.)
dashwid = 0.05;	arrowhead = 2	(Arrowhead fill style)
maxpsht = 11;	maxpswid = 8.5	(Maximum picture dimensions)
fillval = 0.3;	scale = 1
.TE
.S +1
.DE
So if you want all your boxes to be long and skinny, and relatively close together,
.iS
boxwid = 0.1; boxht = 1
movewid = 0.2
box; move; box; move; box
.iE
.DS CB
.PS
boxwid = 0.1; boxht = 1
movewid = 0.2
box; move; box; move; box
.PE
.DE
.PS
x = boxwid
 y = boxht
boxwid = 0.1
 boxht = 1
movewid = 0.2
boxwid = x
 boxht = y
arrowhead = 7
 arrowhead = 2
.PE
.P
Setting the variable
.cR arrowhead
to a value like 7 causes arrowheads to be filled by overstriking;
the default is 2:
.iS
arrowhead = 7; arrow; move; arrowhead = 2; arrow
.iE
.DS CB
.PS
arrowhead = 7; arrow; move; arrowhead = 2; arrow
.PE
.DE
.P
.I Pic
works internally in inches.
Setting the variable
.cR scale
to some value causes all dimensions to be scaled down
by that value.
Thus, for example,
.cR scale=2.54
causes dimensions to be interpreted as centimeters.
.P
The numbers given in the
.cR .PS
line override the dimensions given in the picture;
these can be used to force a picture to a particular width and height.
Experience indicates that a good way to get a picture
of the right size is to enter its dimensions in inches,
then if necessary add a width and perhaps height to the
.cR .PS
line.
.P
Once set, variables like
.cR boxht
retain their values from one picture to the next.
You can reset variables to their default values by listing them in a
.cR reset
statement:
.iS
reset boxht, boxwid
.iE
A bare
.cR reset
resets all variables.
.P
There is a minimal facility for filling or shading objects,
intended for Postscript output devices.
The attribute
.cR fill
.I expr
sets the gray scale value to
.IR expr ;
the default, determined by the variable
.cR fillval ,
is 0.3.
Following Postscript, smaller values are darker.
Thus:
.iS
box fill
box ht boxht/2 wid boxwid/2 "hello" at last box
.iE
.DS CB
.PS
reset
box fill
box ht boxht/2 wid boxwid/2 "hello" at last box
.PE
.DE
.cR fill
currently only applies to boxes, circles, and ellipses.
.H 1 "CONTROLLING POSITIONS"
You can place things anywhere you want;
.I pic
provides a variety of ways to talk about positions.
.I Pic
uses a standard Cartesian coordinate system with
.I x
increasing rightwards and
.I y
increasing upwards,
so any point or object has an
.I x
and
.I y
position, measured in inches.
The first object is placed with its start at position 0,0 by default.
The
.I x,y
position of a box, circle or ellipse is its geometric center;
the position of a line or spline or motion is its beginning;
the position of an arc is the center of the corresponding circle.
.P
Position modifiers like
.cR from ,
.cR to ,
.cR by
and
.cR at
are followed by an
.I x,y
pair, and
can be attached to boxes, circles, lines, motions, and so on,
to specify or modify a position.
.P
You can also use
.cR up ,
.cR down ,
.cR right ,
and
.cR left
with
.cR line
and
.cR move :
.iS
.ta +2.5i
box ht 0.2 wid 0.2 at 0,0 "1"
move right 0.5	# or "move to 0.5,0"
box ht 0.2 wid 0.2 "2"
move right 0.5	# or "move 0.5" or "move same"
box ht 0.2 wid 0.2 "3"
.iE
.DS CB
.PS 2
box ht 0.2 wid 0.2 at 0,0 "1"
move right 0.5	# or "move to 0.5,0"
box ht 0.2 wid 0.2 "2"
move right 0.5	# or "move 0.5" or "move same"
box ht 0.2 wid 0.2 "3"
.PE
.DE
Comments can be used in pictures;
they begin with a
.cR #
and end at the end of the line.
.P
Attributes like
.cR ht
and
.cR wid
and positions like
.cR at
can be written out in any order.
So
.iS
box ht 0.2 wid 0.2 at 0,0
box at 0,0 wid 0.2 ht 0.2
box ht 0.2 at 0,0 wid 0.2
.iE
are all equivalent, though the last is harder to read
and thus less desirable.
.P
The
.cR from
and
.cR to
attributes are particularly useful with arcs,
to specify the endpoints.
By default, arcs are drawn counterclockwise,
.iS
"+" at 0,0
arc -> from 0.5,0 to 0,0.5
arc -> cw from 0,0 to 1,0.5
.iE
.DS CB
.PS
"+" at 0,0
arc -> from 0.5,0 to 0,0.5
arc -> cw from 0,0 to 1,0.5
.PE
.DE
The radius can be made large to provide flat arcs:
.iS
arc -> cw from 0,0 to 2,0 rad 15
.iE
.DS CB
.PS
arc -> cw from 0,0 to 2,0 rad 15
.PE
.DE
If the circle is under-specified,
.I pic
guesses a radius and/or center;
you will have to provide them explicitly if the guess is wrong.
.P
We said earlier that
objects are normally connected left to right.
This is an over-simplification.
The truth is that objects are connected together
in the direction specified by the most recent
.cR up ,
.cR down ,
.cR left
or
.cR right
(either alone or as part of some object).
Thus, in
.iS
arrow left; box; arrow; circle; arrow
.iE
the
.cR left
implies connection towards the left:
.DS CB
.PS
arrow left; box; arrow; circle; arrow
.PE
.DE
This could also be written as
.iS
left; arrow; box; arrow; circle; arrow
.iE
.P
Objects are joined in the direction determined by the last
.cR up ,
.cR down ,
etc., with the entry point of the second object attached
to the exit point of the first
(which is fixed at the time of entry).
Entry and exit points for boxes, circles and ellipses are
on opposite sides.
This automatic connection and direction selection
works well if the direction doesn't change but it will occasionally surprise you:
.iS
arrow; circle; down; arrow
.iE
.DS CB
.PS
arrow; circle; down; arrow
.PE
.DE
The arrow comes out of the right side of the circle, not the bottom,
as might be expected.
.P
If a set of commands is enclosed in braces
.cR {\(el} ,
the current position and direction of motion when the group is finished
will be exactly where it was when entered.
Nothing else is restored.
There is also a more general way to group objects,
using
.cR [
and
.cR ] ,
which is discussed in \(sc9.
.H 1 "LABELS AND CORNERS"
Objects can be labelled or named so that you can talk about them later.
For example,
.iS
Box1:	box
	# \(el other stuff \(el
	move to Box1
.iE
Place names 
.I must
begin with an upper case letter
(to distinguish them from variable names,
which begin with lower case letters).
The name refers to the ``center''
of the object,
which is the geometric center for most things.
.P
.br
.ne 5.5v
Other combinations also work:
.iS
line from Box1 to Box2
move to Box1 up 0.1 right 0.2
move to Box1 + 0.2,0.1	     # same as previous
line to Box1 - 0.5,0
.iE
The reserved name
.cR Here
may be used to refer to the current position.
.P
Labels can be reset several times in a single picture,
so a statement like
.iS
Box1:  Box1 + 1,1
.iE
is perfectly legal.
.P
You can also refer to previously drawn objects of each type,
using the word
.cR last .
For example, given the input
.iS
box "A"; circle "B"; box "C"
.iE
then
.cR last \& `
.cR box '
refers to box
.cR C ,
.cR last \& `
.cR circle '
refers to circle
.cR B ,
and
.cR 2nd \& `
.cR last
.cR box '
refers to box
.cR A .
Numbering of objects can also be done from the beginning,
so boxes
.cR A
and
.cR C
are
.cR 1st \& `
.cR box '
and
.cR 2nd \& `
.cR box '
respectively.
.P
To cut down the need for explicit coordinates,
objects have ``corners'' named by compass points:
.iS
B: box	"B.c" ht 1 wid 1.5
	" B.e" at B.e ljust
	" B.ne" at B.ne ljust
	" B.se" at B.se ljust
	"B.s" at B.s below
	"B.n" at B.n above
	"B.sw " at B.sw rjust
	"B.w " at B.w rjust
	"B.nw " at B.nw rjust
.iE
.rs
.sp 0.5v
.DS CB
.PS
B: box "B.c" ht 1 wid 1.5
" B.e" at B.e ljust
" B.ne" at B.ne ljust
" B.se" at B.se ljust
"B.s" at B.s below
"B.n" at B.n above
"B.sw " at B.sw rjust
"B.w " at B.w rjust
"B.nw " at B.nw rjust
.PE
.DE
.rs
.sp 0.5v
Note the use of
.cR ljust ,
.cR rjust ,
.cR above ,
and
.cR below
to alter the default positioning of text,
and of a blank within some strings to help space them away from a vertical line.
.P
Lines and arrows have a
.cR start ,
an
.cR end
and a 
.cR center
in addition to corners.
Circles and ellipses have corners too;
an arc has the same corners as the circle of which it is a part.
The words
.cR left ,
.cR right ,
.cR top ,
and
.cR bottom
are synonyms for
.cR west ,
.cR east ,
.cR north
and
.cR south .
.P
It is often easiest to position objects by positioning
some part of one at some part of another,
for example the southwest corner of one at the southeast corner
of another.
The
.cR with
attribute
permits this kind of positioning:
.iS
box ht 0.75 wid 0.75
box ht 0.5 wid 0.5 with .sw at last box.se
.iE

Sometimes it is desirable to have a line intersect a circle
at a point which is not one of the eight compass points
that
.I pic
knows about.
In such cases, the proper visual effect can be obtained by using
the attribute
.cR chop
to chop off part of the line:
.iS
circlerad = 0.15; arrowhead = 7
circle "a"
circle "b" at 1st circle - (0.4, 0.6)
circle "c" at 1st circle + (0.4, -0.6)
arrow from 1st circle to 2nd circle chop
arrow from 1st circle to 3rd circle chop

circle "c" at 1st circle + (0.4, -0.6)
arrow from 1st circle to 2nd circle chop
arrow from 1st circle to 3rd circle chop
reset
.PE
.DE
By default the line is chopped by
.cR circlerad
at each end.
This may be changed:
.iS
line \(el chop \f2r\fP
.iE
chops both ends by
\f2r\fP, and
.iS
line \(el chop \f2r1\fP chop \f2r2\fP
.iE
chops the beginning by
.I r1
and the end by
.IR r2 .
More complicated intersections can be computed with
the built-in trigonometric functions listed in the next section.

There is one other form of positioning that is sometimes useful,
to refer to a point some fraction of the way between
two other points.
This can be expressed in 
.I pic
as
.iS
\f2fraction\fP of the way between \f2position1\fP and \f2position2\fP
.iE
where
.I fraction
is any expression, and
.I position1
and
.I position2
are any positions.
You can abbreviate this rather windy phrase;
.cR "of\ the\ way" '' ``
is optional, and the whole thing can
be written instead as
.iS
\f2fraction\fP < \f2position1\fP , \f2position2\fP >

Advice:  Experience suggests that the easiest way to position objects
is by placing them relative to previous objects
and places, using
.cR with ,
.cR at ,
etc.
This is better than using
.cR move ;
you should generally avoid
.cR move .
.H 1 "VARIABLES, EXPRESSIONS AND BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS"
It's generally a bad idea to write everything in 
absolute coordinates if you are likely
to change things.
.I Pic
variables let you parameterize your picture:
.iS
a = 0.5;  b = 1

box wid a ht b
ellipse wid a/2 ht 1.5*b
Box2:  Box1 - (a/2, b/2)
.iE
Expressions may use the standard operators
.cR + ,
.cR - ,
.cR * ,
.cR / ,
.cR % ,
.cR ^
(exponentiation),
and parentheses for grouping.
.P
The most important variables are the predefined ones for
controlling the default sizes of objects,
listed in \(sc3.
These may be set at any time in any picture,
and retain their values from picture to picture until reset.
.P
You can use the height, width, radius,
and
.I x
and
.I y
coordinates of any object or corner in an expression:
.iS
.ta +1.75i
Box1.x	# the \f2x\fP coordinate of the center of Box1
Box1.ne.y	# the \f2y\fP coordinate of the northeast corner of Box1
Box1.wid	# the width of Box1
Box1.ht	# and its height
2nd last circle.rad	# the radius of the 2nd last circle
.iE

Any pair of expressions enclosed in parentheses
defines a position; furthermore such positions
can be added or subtracted to yield new positions:

$cw ( p sub 1 cw , p sub 2 cw )$
refers to the point
$cw ( p sub 1 cw .x^ cw , ^ p sub 2 cw .y)$.

.H 1 "MORE ON TEXT"
Normally, text is centered
at the geometric center of the object it is associated with.
The attribute
.cR ljust
causes the left end to be at the specified point
(which means that the text lies to the right of the specified place!),
and
.cR rjust
puts the right end at the place.
.cR above
and
.cR below
center the text one half line space in the given direction.
.P
Text attributes can be compounded:
.iS
arrow 1 "ljust above" ljust above
.iE
.DS CB
.PS
arrow 1 "ljust above" ljust above
.PE
.DE
.P
Text is most often an attribute of some other object,
but you can also have self-standing text:
.iS

"this is" "(1,1)" at 1,1
box ht 1 wid 1 dotted with .sw at 0,0

In effect, \f2n\fP text strings are contained in an invisible box

.cR textht .
The variables
.cR textwid
and
.cR textht
may be set to any values;
they are normally zero.
.P
A list of numeric expressions can be converted to a formatted string
with the
.cR sprintf
function and used anywhere a quoted string can be:

.H 1 "LINES AND SPLINES"
A ``line'' may actually be a path,
that is, it may consist of connected segments:

.iE
.DS CB
.PS
line right 1 then down .5 left 1 then right 1
.PE

The word
.cR then
separates components of the path.
.P
A spline is a smooth curve guided by a set of straight lines
just like the line above.
It begins at the same place, ends at the same place,
and in between is tangent to the mid-point of each guiding line.
The syntax for a spline is identical to a (path) line
except for using
.cR spline
instead of
.cR line :
.iS
line dashed right 1 then down .5 left 1 then right 1
spline from start of last line \e
  right 1 then down .5 left 1 then right 1
.iE
.DS CB
.PS

spline from start of last line \
  right 1 then down .5 left 1 then right 1
.PE
.DE
(Long input lines can be split by ending each piece
with a backslash.)
.P
The elements of a path, whether line or spline,
are specified as a series of points,
either in absolute terms or by
.cR up ,
.cR down , 
etc.
.iS

of a line or spline.
.H 1 BLOCKS
Any sequence of
.I pic
statements may be enclosed in
brackets
.cR [
and
.cR ]
to form
a block,
which can then be treated as a single object,
and manipulated rather like an ordinary box:
.iS
box "1"
[ box "2"; arrow "3" above; box "4" ] with .n at last box.s - (0,0.1)
"Thing 2: " rjust at last [].w
.iE
.DS CB
.PS
box "1"
[ box "2"; arrow "3" above; box "4" ] with .n at last box.s - (0,0.1)
"Thing 2: " rjust at last [].w
.PE
.DE
.br
.ne 2v
Notice that
``last''-type constructs treat blocks as a unit and don't look
inside for objects:
.cR last "" ``
.cR box.s ''
refers to box 1, not box 2 or 4.
You can use
.cR last\ [] ,
etc.,
just like
.cR last\ box .
.P
Blocks have the same compass corners as
boxes (determined by the bounding box).
It is also
possible to position a block by placing either an absolute 
coordinate (like
.cR 0,0 )
or an internal label (like
.cR A )
at some
external point, as in
.iS
[ \(el; A: \(el; \(el ] with .A at \(el
.iE
By default, blocks join with other things as boxes do, at the
center of the appropriate side.
.P
Names of variables and places within a block are local
to that block, and thus do not affect variables and places
of the same name outside.
(In particular, that includes the built-in variables like
.cR boxwid ,
etc.;
if they are set within a block,
they revert to their original values when the block is left.)
You can get at the internal
place names with constructs like
.iS
last [].A
.iE
or
.iS
B.A
.iE
where
.cR B
is a name attached to a block:
.iS
B:  [ \(el ;  A: \(el;  ]
.iE
When combined with
.cR define
statements (next section), blocks provide
a reasonable simulation of a procedure mechanism.
.P
Although blocks nest,
it is currently possible to look only one level deep
with constructs like
.cR B.A ,
although
.cR A
may be
further qualified by a corner name (i.e.,
.cR B.A.sw
or
.cR top
.cR of
.cR B.A
are legal).
.P
The following example illustrates most of the points made above
about how blocks work:
.iS
h = .5;  dh = .02;  dw = .1
[
	Ptr: [
		boxht = h; boxwid = dw
		A: box
		B: box
		C: box

.H 1 MACROS
.I Pic
provides a basic macro facility.
In the simplest form,
.iS
define  \f2name\fP  { \f2replacement text\fP }
.iE
defines
.I name
to be the
.IR "replacement text" .
Any subsequent occurrence of
.I name
will be replaced by
.IR "replacement text" .
.P
Macros may have arguments.
If the replacement text of a macro definition contains occurrences of
.cR $1 ,
.cR $2 ,
etc.,
these will be replaced by the corresponding actual arguments
when the macro is invoked.
The invocation for a macro with arguments is
.iS
name(arg1, arg2, \(el)
.iE
Non-existent arguments are replaced by null strings.
Macro definitions last from picture to picture;
a macro definition can be removed by
.iS
undef \f2macro-name\fP
.iE
.P
As an example, one might define a
.cR square
by
.iS
define square { box ht $1 wid $1  $2 }
.iE
and use it as
.iS
square(1, "one" "inch")
square(0.5)
square(0.25, "\es-4tiny\es+4" dashed)
.iE
.DS CB

.PE
.DE
Notice how the second argument may be used to pass in arbitrary contents.
.P
Coordinates like
.I x,y
may be enclosed in parentheses,
as in
.RI ( x,y ),
so they can be included in a macro argument.
.H 1 "FILE COPY"
The statement
.iS
copy "\f2filename\fP"
.iE
inserts the contents of the named file
at that point in the input.
Any
.cR .PS
or
.cR .PE
lines within the file
are ignored, so previously prepared pictures
can be used as parts of larger ones without editing.
.br
.ne 4v

.I Pic
also provides the
.cR copy
.cR thru
mechanism found in
.IR grap :
.iS
copy "\f2file\fP" thru \f2macro-name\fP
.iE
copies
.IR file ,
treating each line as an invocation of the named macro
(each field being an argument).
A literal macro may be used instead of a name:
.iS
copy "\f2file\fP" thru { \f2macro replacement text\fP }
.iE
and if no file name is given,
the remainder of the input until the next
.cR .PE
is used.
So to plot a set of circles at points whose coordinates and radii
are included in-line:
.iS
copy thru { circle rad $3 at $1,$2 }
