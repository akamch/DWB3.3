\s-1MV\s+1 \(em A Macro Package
for View Graphs and Slides
.tE
.H 1 "INTRODUCTION"
This manual describes
a package of
.sM UNIX \*(Rg
system
.IR troff
macros called
.sM MV ,
designed for typesetting view graphs and slides.
This manual assumes that the reader has a basic knowledge of the
.sM UNIX
system, an editor,
and the text formatter
.IR troff .
.P
With these macros, one can easily prepare view graphs in a variety of
dimensions (see Table I),
as well as 35-mm slides and 2\^\(mu\^2-inch``super-slides.''
These transparencies can be made in a variety of styles, in different fonts,
with oversize titles, and with highlighted subordination levels.
.P
Since the text from which the foils are typeset is stored in a file,
the contents of a foil can be readily changed to include new data
or can be incorporated into a new presentation.
The text of the foils can be passed through
.IR spell
to check for typos or spelling errors, and can
be preprocessed by
.IR eqn ,
.IR tbl ,
.IR pic ,
or
.I grap
to produce tables, equations, pictures, or graphs,
respectively.
.P
In the remainder of this document, the features of
.sM MV
and how to use it with
.I troff
as well as its preprocessors are shown by example.
Two examples of
.sM MV
input are included in the document;
the remaining input examples are given in the Appendix.
The resulting view graphs are included in the Appendix at the
end of the document.
.H 1 "SIMPLE EXAMPLES"
Before explaining the macros in detail,
the formatting process is illustrated with two examples.
If you are familiar enough with a
.sM UNIX
system editor to create the following
text file, naming it ``trivial'':
.iS
\&.Sw
\&Six stages of a project:
\&.B
\&wild enthusiasm
\&.B
\&disillusionment
\&.B
\&total confusion
\&.B
\&search for the guilty
\&.B
\&punishment of the innocent
\&.B
\&promotion of the non-participants
.iE
and if you then format the file with
.I troff
and the
.sM MV
macros:
.iS
troff -mv trivial | \(el
.iE
you will be rewarded with the view graph
shown in Example 1 in the Appendix.
The
.cR .Sw
is a
.IR "foil-start macro" ;
by looking at that view
graph, you should be able to figure out what the
.cR .B
macro does.
'''	\" FORCE PAGE
.SK
.H 2 "Less Trivial Example"
The following input was used to produce the view graph shown in Example 2 of the Appendix:
.iS
\&.Vw 2 "Less Trivial" "April 1, 1990"
\&.T "What the Walrus Said"
\&`\&`The time has come,'\&' the Walrus said,
\&.BR
\&`\&`To talk of many things:
\&.I .5
\&.B
\&Of shoes\e(emand ships\e(emand sealing wax\e(em
\&.B
\&Of cabbages\e(emand kings\e(em
\&.B
\&And why the sea is boiling hot\e(em
\&.B
\&And whether pigs have wings.'\&'
.iE
The
.cR .Vw
is another foil-start macro and will be discussed in the next section.
A bit later on, you will also find out what the other macros in this example
.cR .T , (
.cR .BR ,
and
.cR .I )
are all about.
(The input string
.cR \e(em
is the
.I troff
name for the long
em-dash.)
.H 1 "THE FOIL-START MACROS"
Each foil
.I must
start with a foil-start macro.
There are nine foil-start macros for generating nine different-sized foils;
the names (and the corresponding mounting-frame sizes)
of these macros are shown in Table\ I.

.P
The naming convention for these nine macros is that the first character of the name
.cR V "" (
or
.cR S )
distinguishes between view graphs and slides,
while the second character indicates whether the foil is
square
.cR S ), (
small wide
.cR w ), (
small high
.cR h ), (
big wide
.cR W ), (
or
big high
.cR H ). (
Slides are
``skinnier'' than the corresponding view graphs:
the ratio of the longer dimension to the shorter one is larger
for slides than for view graphs.
As a result, slide foils can be used for view graphs,
but not vice versa;
on the other hand, view graphs can accommodate a bit more text.
.P
Note that
.cR .VW
and
.cR .SW
produce foils that are 7\^\(mu\^5.4 inches because
commonly available paper for laser printers and some typesetters
is less than 9 inches wide;
these foils must be enlarged by a factor of 9/\^7
before they can be used as 9-inch-wide by 7-inch-high view graphs.
'''	\" FORCE PAGE
.SK
.P
Each foil-start macro causes the previous foil (if any) to be terminated,
foil separators to be produced,
and certain heading information to be generated.
The
.I default
heading information consists of three lines of
.IR right -justified
data:
.nr Ls 0
.P
.BL
.LI
the current date in the form
.I mo/dy/yr
.LI
the company name
.LI
Foil
.I n
.LE
.nr Ls 2
.P
where
.I n
is the sequence number in the current ``run'';
as explained below, this heading information is replaced by
the three arguments of the foil-start macro,
if those arguments are given.
.P
The actual projection area is marked by ``cross-hairs''
(plus signs) that fit into the corners of the view graph mount,
helping one to position the foil for mounting.
All foils other than the square
.cR .VS ) (
foil also have a set of (horizontal or vertical) ``crop marks'';
these indicate how much of the foil will be seen if it is made into a slide,
rather than into a view graph.
.P
The default heading information can be changed by specifying three
optional arguments to the foil-start macro
(square brackets [\ ] are used to indicate that the
argument they enclose is optional):
.DS I
\*(iR.\f(CIXX \|\f1[\|\*(iAn\|\f1] [\|\*(iAid\|\f1] [\|\*(iAdate\|\f1]
.DE
where \f(CIXX\fP stands for one of the line foil-start macros,
.cA n
is the foil
identifier (typically a number),
.cA id
is other identifying information
(typically the initials of the person creating the foil),
and
.cA date
is usually the date.
The resulting heading information consists of
three lines of right-justified text:
.cA id ,
.cA date ,
and
.cR FOIL
.cA n .
If
.cA date
and
.cA id
are omitted on a foil-start macro,
then the corresponding values (if any)
from the previous foil-start macro are used.
.P
See the Appendix for examples of all this.
.H 1 "THE LEVEL MACROS"
The
.sM MV
macros provide four levels of indentation, called
.cR .A ,
.cR .B ,
.cR .C ,
and
.cR .D .
Each of these
.I "level macros"
causes the text that follows it to be placed at the corresponding
level of indentation.
.H 2 "The \*(iR.A\fP Level"
The leftmost (left margin) level is obtained by:
.iS
\&.A \f1[\|\*(iAx\|\f1]
.iE
The
.cR .A
level is automatically invoked by each of the foil-start macros.
Each
.cR .A
macro spaces a half-line from the preceding text,
unless the
.cA x
argument
is specified
.cA x "" (
can be any character or string of characters);
.cA x
suppresses the spacing.
The
.cR .A
macro can also be invoked through the
.cR .I
macro (see \(sc5.2).
.H 2 "The \*(iR.B\fP Level"
.iS
\&.B \f1[\|\*(iAmark\|\f1 [\|\*(iAsize\|\f1]\|]
.iE
The
.cR .B
level items are marked by a bullet (in a slightly
reduced point size).
The text that follows the
.cR .B
macro is spaced
one-half line from the preceding text.
The
.cR .B
level mark may be changed by specifying the desired mark
(which may be any character string)
as the first argument
.cA mark ). (
Without the second argument, the point size of the mark is not
reduced.
Thus, one can produce a numbered list as follows:
.iS
\&.VS
\&This is a list of things:
\&.B 1.
\&This is thing number 1.
\&.B 2.
\&This is thing number 2.
\&.B 3.
\&This is the third and last thing on this foil.
.iE
.br
.ne 5v
It is possible to change the point size of the mark:
the second argument
.cA size ), (
if given, specifies the desired point-size change.
An unsigned or positive (+) argument is taken as an increment;
a negative (\-) argument is a decrement;
an argument greater than 99 causes the mark to be reduced in size
just as if it were the default mark, namely the bullet.
After the mark is printed, the previous point size is restored.
All these point-size changes are
.I completely
invisible to the user.
.H 2 "The \*(iR.C\fP Level"
.iS
\&.C \f1[\|\*(iAmark\|\f1 [\|\*(iAsize\f1\|]\|]
.iE
The
.cR .C
level is just like the
.cR .B
level
.I except
that is is
indented farther to the right than the
.cR .B
level and the default mark is a long
em-dash (\(em), also in a slightly reduced point size.
.H 2 "The \*(iR.D\fP Level"
.iS
\&.D \f1[\|\*(iAmark\|\f1 [\|\*(iAsize\|\f1]\|]
.iE
The
.cR .D
level's default mark is a bullet (smaller than that used for the
.cR .B
level);
the
.cR .D
level is indented farther to the right than the
.cR .C
level and is does
.I not
space from the previous text;
it just causes the following text to start
on a new line (in other words, it causes a
.IR break ).
Otherwise, it behaves just like the
.cR .B
and
.cR .C
levels.
.H 2 "More about Levels"
.BL
.LI
The
.cR .A
macro never generates a mark of any sort; it is the ``left-margin'' macro.
.LI
Repeated
.cR .A
calls are ignored, but each successive call of any of the other
three level macros generates the corresponding mark.
.LI
The amount of vertical pre-spacing generated by each level macro
can be changed with the
.cR .DV
macro
(see \(sc6.2).
.LI
Example 3 in the Appendix is devoted to the level macros.
.LE
.H 1 "THE TITLE AND INDENT MACROS"
.H 2 "Titles"
The title macro
.cR .T
creates a centered title from its argument:
.iS
\&.T \*(iAstring
.iE
The size of the title is four points larger than the prevailing point size.
Remember that the argument must be enclosed within double quotes
(\f5"\f1\(el\f5"\f1)
if it contains blanks.
Any indentation established by the
.cR .I
macro has no effect on titles;
they are always centered within the foil's horizontal dimension.
.P
See Examples 2, 3, and 4 in the Appendix.
.H 2 "Global Indents"
The entire text (except titles) of the foil may be shifted right or left
by the
.cR .I
macro:
.iS
\&.I \f1[\|\*(iAindent\|\f1] [\|\*(iAa\f1\| [\|\*(iAx\|\f1]\|]
.iE
The first argument is the amount of indentation that is to be
used to establish a new left margin.
This argument may be signed positive or negative,
indicating right or left movement from the current margin.
If unsigned,
'''	\" FORCE PAGE
'ne 1i
the argument specifies the new margin,
relative to the
.I initial
default margin.
If the argument is not dimensioned,
it is assumed to be in inches.
If the argument is null or omitted,
.cR 0i
is assumed, causing the
margin to revert to the initial default margin.
.P
If a second argument is specified, the
.cR .I
macro calls the
.cR .A
macro before exiting.
The third argument, if present, is passed to the
.cR .A
macro.
.P
See Examples 1, 2 and 4 in the Appendix.
.H 1 "SIZE AND FONT CONTROL"
.H 2 "Point Sizes and Line Lengths"
Each foil-start macro begins the foil
with an appropriate default point size
and line length.
Table\ II shows, for each style of view graph, the default point size,
the maximum number of lines of text (at the default point size),
and the height, width, and ``aspect ratio,'' both nominal and
actual.

.P
The prevailing point size and the line length may be changed
by invoking the
.cR .S
macro:
.iS
\&.S \f1[\|\*(iAps\|\f1] [\|\*(iAll\|\f1]
.iE
If
.cA ps
is null, the
.I previous
point size is restored.
If
.cA ps
is signed negative,
the point size is decremented by the specified amount.
If
.cA ps
is signed positive, it is used as an
increment, and if
.cA ps
is unsigned, it is used as the new
point size.
If
.cA ps
is greater than 99,
the
.I "initial default"
point size is restored (see Table\ II).
Vertical spacing is
always 1.25 times the current point size.
.P
The second argument, if given, specifies the line length.
It may be dimensioned.
If it is
.I not
dimensioned and less than 10, it is taken as inches;
if it is
.I not
dimensioned and greater than or equal to 10,
it is taken as
.I troff
units.
The
.cR .S
macro changes the point size and vertical spacing
immediately, but a line-length change
requested with that macro does not take effect until the next
level-macro call.
.P
See Examples 3, 4, and 6 in the Appendix.
.H 2 "Default Vertical Space"
The vertical space macro allows one to change
the vertical pre-spacing done by each of the four
level macros:
.iS
\&.DV \f1[\|\*(iAa\|\f1]\0[\|\*(iAb\|\f1]\0[\|\*(iAc\|\f1]\0[\|\*(iAd\|\f1]
.iE
The first argument
.cA a
is the spacing for
.cR .A ,
.cA b
is for 
.cR .B ,
.cA c
is for
.cR .C ,
and
.cA d
is for
.cR .D .
All non-null arguments must be dimensioned; null arguments leave the
corresponding spacing unaffected.
.P
By default,
the
.cR .A ,
.cR .B ,
and
.cR .C
level macros generate one-half vertical pre-space, and the
.cR .D
level macro generates no vertical pre-space.
The initial setting is equivalent to:
.iS
\&.DV .5v .5v .5v 0v
.iE
.H 2 "Default Fonts"
The macros assume that the Helvetica font, mounted in
position 1, is the default font.
Additional fonts can be mounted and the default font
can be changed:
.iS
\&.DF \*(iAn\0font\| \f1[\|\*(iAn\0font\| \f1[\|\(el\|]\|]
.iE
The
.cR .DF
macro informs
.I troff
that
.cA font
is mounted on position
.cA n .
The first-named font is the default font.
Up to four pairs of arguments may be specified.
The
.cR .DF
macro must immediately precede a foil-start macro; the initial
setting is equivalent to:
.iS
\&.DF 1 H 2 I 3 B 4 BI
.iE
By default, the constant-width font
.cR CW ) (
is mounted on position 5.
See Examples 4 and 5 in the Appendix.
.H 2 "Underlining"
The underline macro
.cR .U
takes one or two arguments:
.iS
\&.U \*(iAstring1\|\f1 [\|\*(iAstring2\|\f1]
.iE
The first argument is the string of characters to be
underlined.
The second argument, if present, is not underlined,
but concatenated to the first argument.
For example,
.iS
\&.U phototypesetter
.iE
produces
.DS I
.us "phototypesetter"
.DE
.br
.ne 7v
while
.iS
\&.U under line
.iE
produces
.DS I
\&under\l'|0\(ul'line
.DE
See Example 4 in the Appendix.
.H 1 "USING \f4troff\fP COMMANDS AND SYMBOLS"
.H 2 "Use of \f4troff\fP Requests"
In general, it is not advisable to intermix arbitrary
.I troff
requests with the
.sM MV
macros, because this often leads to undesirable
(and sometimes downright astonishing) results.
The ``safe'' requests are the ones for which upper-case
synonyms have been defined in the
.sM MV
package:
.iS
\&.AD  .BR  .CE  .FI  .HY  .NA  .NF  .NH  .NX  .SO  .SP  .TA  .TI
.iE
Other
.I troff
requests should be used sparingly (if at all),
and with care and discipline.
Particularly dangerous are the requests that affect point size,
indentation, page offset, line and title lengths,
and vertical spacing between lines;
use the
.cR .S
and
.cR .I
macros instead.
.P
.ul
Reserved Names.
Certain names are used internally by this macro package.
In particular, all two-character names
starting with either ) and ] are reserved.
Names that are the same as names of the
.sM MV
macros
and strings described in this manual, or the same as any
.I troff
names, cannot be used either.
Furthermore, if any of the preprocessors (see \(sc8) are used,
their reserved names must also be avoided.
.H 2 "Breaks"
The
.cR .S ,
.cR .DF ,
.cR .DV ,
and
.cR .U
macros do
.I not
cause a break;
the
.cR .I
macro causes a break
.I only
if it is invoked with more than one argument;
all the other
.sM MV
macros
.I always
cause a break.
The
.I troff
synonyms
.cR .AD ,
.cR .BR ,
.cR .CE ,
.cR .FI ,
.cR .NA ,
.cR .NF ,
.cR .SP ,
and
.cR .TI
also cause a break.
.H 2 "Text Filling, Adjusting, and Hyphenation"
By default, the
.sM MV
macros fill, but neither adjust nor hyphenate text.
This is an aesthetic judgement that seems correct for foils.
These defaults can, of course, be changed by using the
.cR .AD ,
.cR .FI ,
.cR .HY ,
.cR .NA ,
.cR .NF ,
and
.cR .NH
macros.
.H 2 "Defined Strings"
The registered mark, service mark, and trademark symbols
are defined as strings in the
.sM MV
package.
Use the following string to generate the corresponding symbol:
.DS
.TS
center box;
cf1 cf1 cf1
lf5 cf1 lf1.
String	Symbol	Description
_
\e*(Rg	\*(Rg	registered mark
\e*(Tm	\*(Tm	trademark
\e*(Sm	\*(Sm	service mark
.TE
.DE
Use the registration symbol for registered marks;
for unregistered marks, use the service mark symbol or the
trademark symbol, as appropriate.
Marks should always be used as adjectives when they appear
in printed text (e.g., \s-1UNIX\s+1\*(Rg system, Tuxedo\*(Tm software,
\s-1ACCUNET\s+1\^\*(Sm digital services).
.H 2 "Unpaddable Space"
Normally,
.I troff
treats a space as an appropriate place to
break the line or to insert extra space to
fill out the line.
An ``unpaddable'' space is a fixed-size non-adjustable space;
.I troff
will neither pad nor break the line at this space.
To produce an unpaddable space, use the built-in
.I troff
escape sequence
.cR \e\(sq
where
.cR \(sq
is a single space from the keyboard.
.br
.ne 3v
.P
A popular convention is to use a visible character
to represent an unpaddable space.
The
.sM MV
package does not
provide a visible unpaddable space character by default.
To define one, you must use the
.I troff
.cR .tr
request in the beginning of the file
to translate the desired character to space.
For example, the request
.iS
\&.tr ~
.iE
translates a tilde into white space.
You can then use
.cR ~
in the text to represent an unpaddable space.
To print a tilde, the request
.iS
\&.tr ~~
.iE
will translate
.cR ~
back into itself.
.H 1 "THE \f4troff\fP \^PREPROCESSORS"
It is possible to use the various
.I troff
preprocessors to typeset
foils that require more powerful formatting capabilities.
.BL
.LI
The
.IR tbl
program can be used to set up columns of data within
a view graph or slide.
The
.cR .TS
and
.cR .TE
macros mark the start and end of
.I tbl
input.
See Examples 4 and 6 in the Appendix.
.LI
The
.IR eqn
program can be used to typeset
mathematical expressions and formulas on foils,
provided one is
careful to specify the proper fonts and point sizes.
The
.cR .EQ
and
.cR .EN
macros mark the start and end of
.I eqn
input for displayed equations, and to set delimiters for in-line equations.
See Examples 5 and 6 in the Appendix.
.LI
The
.IR pic
program can be used to draw simple pictures.
One may need to adjust the size of objects to accommodate the
text within.
The
.cR .PS
and
.cR .PE
macros mark the start and end of
.I pic
input.
See Example 7 in the Appendix.
.LI
The
.IR grap
program is a preprocessor to
.I pic
and can be used to plot graphs and display statistical data.
One may need to adjust the size and placement of labels due to
the larger text size.
The
.cR .G1
and

.H 1 "THE FINISHED PRODUCT"
.H 2 "Laser Printer and Phototypesetter Output"
Laser printer output is more than adequate for most view graphs
and slides; in some cases, actual phototypesetter output may be
desired.
Output is obtained via the formatting command:
.iS
troff -mv \f1[\*(iAoptions\|\f1]\0\*(iAfilename\*(iR | \(el
.iE
where
.cA filename
contains the text and the macro invocations for the foils, and
.cA options
can be one or more
.I troff
command line options.
.P
If any of the
.I troff
preprocessors are used,
they must appear before
.I troff
on the command line and the filename is given to the first preprocessor:
.iS
tbl \*(iAfilename\*(iR | eqn | troff -mv \f1[\*(iAoptions\|\f1] \*(iR | \(el
.iE
When
.I eqn
and
.I tbl
are used together on the same file,
.I tbl
should be used first;
if there are no equations within tables,
either order works.
Since
.I grap
is a preprocessor to
.IR pic ,
.I grap
must precede
.I pic
on the command line.
For example, given a file which contains
the input for several view graphs with tables, equations,
pictures, and a graph, the command line:
.iS
grap \*(iAfile\fP | pic | tbl | eqn | troff -mv \f1[\*(iAoptions\|\f1]\*(iR | \(el
.iE
produces the set of view graphs using the preprocessors
discussed in \(sc8.
.H 2 "Output Approximation on a Terminal"
One can obtain an approximation of the typeset output
by entering the command:
.iS
troff -a -mv \*(iAfilename\*(iR | \(el
.iE
.nr Ls 0
The resulting output shows the formatted foils except that:

.BL
.LI
Point-size changes are not visible.
.LI
Font changes cannot be seen.
.LI
Titles that are too long appear proper.
.LI
All horizontal motions are reduced to one horizontal space to
the right.
.LI
All vertical motions are reduced to one vertical space down.
.LE
.nr Ls 6
.P
Thus, for example, it appears that the lines of text following a
.cR .B ,
.cR .C ,
or
.cR .D
macro do not
align properly (even though, in fact, they do).
.P
Although alignment cannot be determined from this approximation,
one can observe line breaks and the amount of vertical space used by the
text.
If the foil is not full, the macro package prints the number of
blank lines (in the then current point size)
that remain on the foil;
if the foil is full, a warning is printed.
If the text
.I did
overflow the foil, text will be printed after the
``cross-hairs.''
.H 2 "Making Actual View Graphs and Slides"
The output of the typesetter is so-called ``mechanical
paper,'' which is white, opaque photographic paper with black letters.
There are several very simple processes
for making transparent foils from opaque paper.
Because some of these processes involve heat,
and because mechanical paper is heat
sensitive, one should first make copies of the typesetter output
(as well as laser printer output)
on a good-quality office copier,
and then use these copies for making
the transparencies.
.P
Getting slides made is a much more
complicated photographic process that is best left to professionals.
It is possible to make both positive (opaque letters on transparent
background) and negative (transparent letters on opaque background)
slides, as well as colored-background slides.

.H 1 "OPINIONS AND SUGGESTIONS"
The following suggestions and opinions have
been derived from experience,
from the examination of several other macro
packages for making foils,
and from some publications that discuss good and bad foil-making
practices:
.P
\(rh \f2Foils 3 and 4 in the Appendix violate some or most of the ``rules''
given below.\f1
.BL
.LI
The most useful foil sizes are
.cR .VS
and
.cR .Vw
(or
.cR .Sw ).
This is because most projection screens are either square, or ``wide''
(i.e., are wider than they are tall), and also
because the resulting foils are smaller, easier
to carry, and require no enlargement before using.
.LI
The
.I default
point size for each type of foil (see Table\ II) is the
.I smallest
point size that will result in a foil that is legible by an
audience of more than a dozen people.
Reducing the point size
below the default should be avoided.
If you have more text than fits onto a foil, do not
reduce the point size; use two or more foils instead.
.LI
Do not abuse font changes.
Most novice foil-makers tend to use too many typefaces,
resulting in foils that look cluttered and distract the viewer.
Be sure you need to use a different typeface
(e.g., for spatial emphasis);
when in doubt, stick to a single typeface.
You should almost never use more than two different typefaces
on a single foil.
.LI
Even though this package contains a macro for underlining,
do not use it:
underlined typeset text almost always looks awful;
instead, if necessary, use a different typeface.
.LI
The Helvetica sans-serif font (which is the default font used by
this package) is ``fatter'' and is,
in foils,
considered easier to read than, for instance,
the Times Roman or Palatino serif fonts used
for typesetting normal, ``running''
text (such as the text in this paragraph).
On the other hand, the Times Roman font will allow you to
``squeeze'' a bit more
text onto a foil.
On the whole, the choice of fonts is primarily a matter of personal
aesthetics.
.LI
If possible, use the
.cR .SP
macro to insert a bit of additional
white space (say,
.cR .5v
or
.cR 1v ,
where
.cR v
means ``vertical space'')
at the top of each foil (i.e., increase the top margin).
.LI
Some people believe that foils should not contain any lower-case
alphabetic characters to maximize legibility; this is not necessarily true:
``normal'' upper-and-lower-case
text is far more legible
than upper-case-only text.
Upper-and-lower-case alphabets have evolved and been refined
over millenia precisely because they
result in more legible text.
Furthermore, such text is less ``bulky'' than upper-case-only
text, so one can get more information onto a foil without crowding it.
.LI
Make all the foils for a presentation as consistent as possible;
changing fonts, typefaces, point sizes, etc.,
from foil to foil tends to jar and distract the viewer.
While it is possible to introduce emphasis and draw
the viewer's attention to particular
items with such changes, this only works if you do it very purposefully and
very sparingly; overuse of these techniques
is almost always counter-productive.
.LE

.P
In summary, the dictum that ``the medium is the message''
does not apply to foil making.
When in doubt:
.P
.BL
.LI
Do not change point sizes.
.LI
Do not change fonts or typefaces.
.LI
Do not underline!
.LI
Use many ``sparse'' foils, rather than few ``dense'' ones.
.LI
Use fewer words, rather than more.
.LI
Use larger point sizes, rather than smaller.
.LI
Use larger top and bottom margins, rather than smaller.
.LI
Use normal upper-and-lower-case text, rather than
upper-case only.
