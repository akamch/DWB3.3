Latest ms macro package - from Lorinda Cherry and Brian Kernighan.
Following the research model and installing macros in /usr/lib/tmac.

The coversheet macros (tmac.cs and tmac.rscover) are included but
not installed. Nicely done, but may conflict with the version that
handles the mm macros. Install them only if you know exactly what
you're doing!
