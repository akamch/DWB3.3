.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mps
is a collection of macros designed for PostScript printers.
.B mps
includes
.BR mcolor (5),
.BR mpictures (5)
and the following macros:
.TP .5i
.MW .lM
Start landscape mode printing on a new page.
Does nothing if the current page length is
less than or equal to the current line length.
.TP .5i
.MW .pM
Start portrait mode printing on a new page.
Does nothing if the current page length is
greater than or equal to the current line length.
.PP
The
.MW .lM
and
.MW .pM
macros are designed to change the orientation of individual pages.
They are not recommended for changing the orientation of an entire
document.
.SH BUGS
The
.MW .lM
and
.MW .pM
macros do not work in displays or keeps.
.PP
The
.MW .lM
and
.MW .pM
macros require DWB 3.3 or later versions of
.BR dpost .
.PP
The current implementation of
.MW .lM
and
.MW .pM
results in PostScript that does not correctly survive
simple operations like page reversal.
When
.MW .lM
or
.MW .pM
are used the PostScript generated by
.B dpost
should be sent unmodified to your printer.
