The MM and MV macro packes contain company-specific information
and should be tuned to suit the customer's work evironment.
 -  The MV package defines a string for the company name.
 -  The MM package defines several strings for the company logo,
    company name, location addresses, and proprietary markings
    and copyright notices.

The strings listed below should be redefined as appropriate:


MV:

	)N	company name


MM:

	IN FILE strings.mm :

	]S	company logo
	}Z	company name

	The text for proprietary markings and copyright notices
	are defined as a series of strings, one string per line.
	In the definition of the .PM macro (files mmt and mmn),
	the type determines which strings are used and how many
	lines are needed at the bottom of the page.  The strings
	for each type are implemented as three-part titles (.tl)
	following the .(B macro; the number of lines needed at the
	bottom of page is given as second argument to the .(E macro.
	The allotted strings for .PM can be defined in any way and
	used in any combination provided the are defined properly
	with respect to .(B and .(E.
	Default string assignments for type are:

	]M	line 1 of type P or 1
	]O	line 2 of same

	]A	line 1 of type RS or 2
	]F	line 2 of same
	]G	line 3 of same

	]I	line 1 of type RG or 3
	]J	line 2 of same
	]K	line 3 of same

	]U	only line of type CP or 4

	]i	line 1 of type CR or 5
	]j	line 2 of same

	]m	line 1 of type UW or 6
	]o	line 2 of same
	]p	line 3 of same
	]q	line 4 of same
		(also uses ]i and ]j)

	IN FILES mmn AND mmt :

	Location code strings are assigned addresses directly in
	the defintion of the >5 (released-paper style) macro.
	In many cases, the location code is also the name of the string.
	Some locations have the same address, so some codes map into
	a single location code string.  In the case where the location
	code name was already defined as a macro or string for some
	other purpose, the code name is checked in the definition of
	the .AU (author) macro and then assigned a different string
	name to hold the address.
