    Any version of roff (e.g. UNIX V7) does count \} as a macro
    argument regarding \n(.$.  This makes \n(.$ rather random if
    you cannot force users to put \} on a separate line *or* to
    put it behind the macro call and substract 1 from \n(.$.  To
    make \n(.$ meaningful again this bug has been fixed now, i.e.
    \} is not considered as a macro argument anymore.
